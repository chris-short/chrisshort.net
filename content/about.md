### Extended Bio

Chris Short has worked in the Information Technology field since 1995. Getting his start working summers and vacations for manufacturing and textile companies, Chris quickly latched on to the fast-paced tech sector and has been advancing technology as a resource since his youth. As a senior in high school, he was the webmaster at [sandtech.net](http://sandtech.net), a dial-up Internet Service Provider, in Hickory, NC and embracing Linux as a platform in the largely Windows world of the late 90s.

When the [Dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) began to burst and trouble loomed on the horizon for tech jobs, Chris joined the US Air Force as a [Tech Controller (3C2X1)](https://chrisshort.net/3c2x1-tech-control/). In October 2003, while conducting a training exercise, Chris suffered an injury that damaged his [long thoracic nerve](https://chrisshort.net/long-thoracic-nerve-palsy). However, that did not deter Chris from trying to exceed all expectations despite living in continuous pain. In 2010, Chris was medically separated from the Air Force.

Chris is now working in the Linux systems and DevOps spaces. He writes for several publications and maintains the [DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com) newsletter. He calls the Research Triangle area of North Carolina his home. His up to date [Résumé](/resume-cv/) or [Curriculum Vitae](/resume-cv/) is available.

### Logo: Why the Shrug?

Previous versions of chrisshort.net have had just a text based logo. This was simple but never really did it for me. I wanted to add something simple but nothing was coming to mind. "What shape defines you?" I asked myself. Simply nothing came to mind.

I was iMessaging my wife one afternoon and decided to ask for her input on a logo for the site. She said the text based logo was very plain (I agreed but conceded I was no graphic artist). Then she responded with ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

The chrisshort.net logo was then born. We will see how long it sticks around.
