There are many causes worth supporting out there. It's important that you help out organizations doing good in the world. At the very least, set up [Amazon Smile](https://smile.amazon.com) to support your charity of choice. Here is a list of causes I support:

## Electronic Frontier Foundation

Website: [eff.org](https://www.eff.org/)

> The Electronic Frontier Foundation is the leading nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world. Founded in 1990, EFF champions user privacy, free expression, and innovation through impact litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism, and technology development. We work to ensure that rights and freedoms are enhanced and protected as our use of technology grows.

## Open Source Initiative

Website: [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)

> We are the stewards of the Open Source Definition (OSD) and the community-recognized body for reviewing and approving licenses as OSD-conformant.

## Free Software Foundation

Once they ditched Stallman they were deserving of my support even though they're a little more zealous than I am about open source.

Website: [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/)

> Free software developers guarantee everyone equal rights to their programs; any user can study the source code, modify it, and share the program. By contrast, most software carries fine print that denies users these basic rights, leaving them susceptible to the whims of its owners and vulnerable to surveillance.

## Wikimedia Foundation

Website: [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/)

> The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia and our other free knowledge projects. We want to make it easier for everyone to share what they know. To do this, we keep Wikipedia and Wikimedia sites fast, reliable, and available to all. We protect the values and policies that allow free knowledge to thrive. We build new features and tools to make it easy to read, edit, and share from the Wikimedia sites. Above all, we support the communities of volunteers around the world who edit, improve, and add knowledge across Wikimedia projects.

## Internet Archive

Website: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)

> Internet Archive is a non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more.

## Pin-Ups for Vets

Website: [Pin-Ups For Vets](https://www.pinupsforvets.com/)

> My late Grandpa Lou served in the Army for 4 years during World War II.  I wanted to do something to honor his name.  I always loved the romance of those bygone eras - especially the 1940's - and I drew inspiration from the World War II pin-up girls, whose photos and paintings boosted morale for our soldiers fighting overseas.  
>
> I came up with the idea to recreate a nostalgic pin-up calendar that would serve three purposes:
>
> 1. The calendars would be sold to raise funds for our hospitalized Veterans.
> 2. The calendars would be delivered as gifts to our ill and injured Veterans with messages of appreciation from the donors.
> 3. The calendars would be sent to our deployed troops to help boost morale and to let them know that Americans back home are thinking of them.

## K2 Challenge via The Cloudcast
