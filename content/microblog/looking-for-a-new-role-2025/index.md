My time at Amazon Web Services (AWS) is coming to an end. It's been an incredible three years of work on open source projects like Finch, Valkey, Kubernetes services and the upstream project.

**If you're hiring, [we should talk](/contact/).**

## What I am looking for in my next role

I'm looking for a role at the intersection of technology, marketing, and/or advocacy (developer or otherwise). I have skills and experience in these areas and would like to continue using them. Roles with a substantial overlap between technical know-how in the infrastructure world and how we communicate about it through disciplines like marketing and advocacy are right up my alley.

### Open source, cloud native, Kubernetes, and a partridge in a pear tree

If you are building cloud native tools or Kubernetes-based platforms, I have extensive experience, connections, and influence in this space. As a Kubernetes Contributor Communications co-lead and Senior Developer Advocate at AWS, and during my time at Red Hat, I’ve helped shape the cloud native ecosystem.

I've demonstrated practical expertise by organizing major events like AWS re:Invent's EKS track (with 50+ speakers and 30+ sessions) and leading GitOpsCon EU 2021 as an organizer and host/emcee. My hands-on experience includes teaching AWS developers about open source, consulting on strategy for tools like Finch, and previously leading a successful $1M cloud migration to AWS. From writing – including launching newsletters and authoring critical release blogs – to building demos and workshops to creating compelling live streams and videos – these are skills I've been developing since the late 1990s.

My track record includes producing and hosting over 700 hours of content through OpenShift.TV (later Red Hat Livestreaming) and running high-profile events like AWS Container Day at KubeCon EU 2023. I bring a unique combination of technical depth and communication expertise.

### Remote for work-life-disability balance

The role needs to be remote. My injuries (disabled veteran), coupled with anxiety and PTSD, are properly managed here at home. My medical team agrees with this. It's tough to re-establish a medical team like the one I've been able to build here, especially for nerve and spine damage.

At Red Hat and AWS, I spent significant time in offices: meetings, launches, event planning, onboarding new folks, etc. Having a major international airport and Delta hub in my backyard enables me to be anywhere with little notice. On the open source team at AWS, I went to a London Summit with one day's notice to fill in for a colleague who fell ill over the weekend. No sweat.
