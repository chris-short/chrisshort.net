A subtweet is such a common thing that it has entered the English lexicon. The term itself has a very specific meaning according to [Oxford Living Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/subtweet):

> (on the social media application Twitter) a post that refers to a particular user without directly mentioning them, typically as a form of furtive mockery or criticism.
>
> ‘while he didn't include Smith's Twitter handle, that didn't stop Smith from seeing the post, taking umbrage, and firing off a subtweet of his own'

Subtweets are one way to provide feedback on a hot button issue without becoming the target of harassment by those directly involved in the issue.

It's also a way to passive-aggressively escalate an interpersonal issue. This is done in unhealthy ways across many communities. Remember, like most tools, a subtweet can be used to great benefit or great detriment.

But, even the Washington Post believes subtweets are terrible, [*Study confirms what you always knew: People who subtweet are terrible*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/06/study-confirms-what-you-always-knew-people-who-subtweet-are-terrible/). Thus, the general impression is a subtweet is a very negative thing. But, here is one potential example of a positive subtweet:
