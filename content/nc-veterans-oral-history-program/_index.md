As part of a North Carolina State Archives initiative to obtain oral histories of veterans I volunteered to be interviewed for the [North Carolina Veterans Oral History Collection](https://archives.ncdcr.gov/researchers/collections/military-collections/veterans-oral-history-program). I was interviewed by Matthew Peek, Military Collection Archivist for the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.

The interview was well worth the time it took to coordinate and conduct it. I would encourage all North Carolina veterans to contact the North Carolina Historian and provide their unique story for preservation.
