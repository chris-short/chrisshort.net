## Description

### Key Terms and Organizations

- Upstream: The open source project
- Downstream: The product based on open source project
- [Upstream vs Downstream](/upstream-vs-downstream)
- Open Source Initiative (OSI): Governs open source definition and licenses
- Linux Foundation: Oversees many open source foundations (501(c)(6) non-profit)
- Apache Software Foundation: Oversees many projects (501(c)(3) charitable organization)

### What is Open Source

- Definition: Software released under an OSI-approved license
- Licenses comply with the Open Source Definition (OSD)
- Different licenses grant different freedoms
- Open source is a software development method, not a business model

### Commercializing Open Source

- Hosting and Support
- Training, Certification, and Consulting
- Sponsorships, donations
- Dual licensing: free for personal use; paid for commercial use
- Open Core (COSS): basic features open, value-add features paid
  - Controversial but has some success stories (MongoDB, GitLab, Elastic)

### Free Software and Copyleft

- Linux kernel uses GNU GPL version 2 from Free Software Foundation (FSF)
- Copyleft licenses stipulate:
  - Works must be released with the original license
  - Works may be used, modified, and distributed freely
  - Derivative works are bound by the same conditions

### Common Problems

- Businesses not understanding open source
- Open source communities not understanding businesses
- Different incentives at work
  - Community, collaboration, and code are at the heart of open source
  - Revenue, efficiency, and customers are at the heart of businesses
  - Both are important for either to succeed

### Rule #1: Don't take yourself too seriously

- Don't take feedback personally (cannot stress this enough)
- Stay grounded and balanced
- Customer obsession â‰  Obsessive-compulsive

### Rule #2: Be humble, open, and honest

- Learn from others in the community
- Leave assumptions at the door
- Be friendly always
- Welcome newcomers; encourage participation
- Ask questions in public channels
- Be transparent about your objectives
- Share your knowledge with others

### Rule #3: Everyone has an agenda

- That's usually OK (until it isn't)
- Coopetition exists
- Look for opportunities to collaborate on shared goals
- Review objectively and subjectively
- Don't disguise goals or agendas
- You represent your organization and yourself

### Rule #4: Make your own karma

- Trust is earned over a long time; lost in a moment
- Treat people with respect
- Have empathy when interacting with others
- "Carry the water, fetch the wood"

### Rule #5: Meet community where they are, not where you want them to be

- Learn tooling; ask for help
- Contributors are globally distributed
- Participate in planning, meetings, work sessions
- Your first contributions will be very small
- Don't make uninformed assumptions
- Follow available guides

### Rule #6: Contribution comes in many forms

- Never underestimate the power of docs
- Release management is a great way to learn about project tooling
- Never disregard or dismiss non-code contributions
- Understand the product management used by the project
- Projects often need help improving quality and documentation

### Rule #7: Code reviews are a conversation

- Be curious
- Ask questions; never make assumptions
- Nit-picking No Nos
- Good code reviews takes time
- Set aside periods of uninterrupted time to conduct code reviews

### Rule #8: Explain your work clearly

- Connect contributions to business goals
- Contribution is an "AND", not an "OR"
- Be clear about time investment
- Set up time blocks for contributing
- Don't expect contributions to occur in employee free time

### Rule #9: Share knowledge regularly

- Knowledge sharing is a key component of collaboration upstream
- Share the why not just the how
- Encourage distribution of useful information in your teams

### Rule #10: No separate open source teams

- Leads to an "us vs. them" mentality
- All team members should be able to participate in open source projects aligned to company goals
- Contributing ensures community and corporate health

### Rule #11: Choose carefully

- Choose the projects you depend on carefully
- Some projects don't work as open source
- Weigh whether or not to release as open source
- Don't be afraid to say "no" (respectfully)
