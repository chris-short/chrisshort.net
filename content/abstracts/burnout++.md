## Abstract

Burnout can happen at any point in everyone's career. But, what happens when burnout is taking place amongst other things? Your s/o having a miscarriage? Veteran dealing with time in service and injuries from it? Becoming unemployed? Let's discuss realizing you're approaching or are burned out, the why behind that, and coping mechanisms.

## Description

### What is Burnout?

* Definitions (sourced)
* Who it impacts? Yes. Even kids deal with this.
* Personal Story Thread: The year of yes can turn into years of "please stop"

### Burnout+

* Veteran
* Injured (disabled veteran; disability in general)
* Have Kids (always stressful or worrisome)
* Contribute to open source (never feel like you're doing your best)
* Have a side hustle (Yeah, I wrote a weekly newsletter for six years)
* Dealing with it all (do it before you snap)

### Introduce a Little Chaos

* A miscarriage
* A job lost/layoffs
* A global pandemic
* Toxic family members
* Personal Story Thread: A Netflix series that hit WAY too close to home

### Welcome to burnout++ â€” Managing the Chaos

* Friends & Family - Prioritize family, tell your friends, be forward
* Compartmentalization (lock it in a box for short bursts) !!!WARNING!!!
* The truth will set you free; be honest with yourself

### Medical Conditions Can Occur Due to Burnout

* Increased anxiety (all the way up to paralyzing panic attacks)
* Fatigue, repetitive use injuries, etc.
* Clouded thoughts
* Mood swings
* High blood pressure (living in the red)
* Far Worse

### Fight or Flight

* You can be in a constant fight mode; this is what, "The fog of war," kinda comes from
* This feeling is built into our DNA
* Being aware of your body and the remedies needed to center yourself
* Meditation, grounding, situational awareness, and much more

### Everything is interconnected

* When I get anxious; I don't think clearly
* When I get anxious; my blood pressure goes up
* When I get anxious; my pain levels go up
* This interconnectedness has completely wiped me out before (story about the last panic attack)
* All this starts like a snowball heading down a mountain; once you get to the end you have a devastating avalanche
* If the anxiety builds daily over time a blow up is bound to happen

### Acceptance

* The sooner you accept the situation you're in the sooner you can improve it
* DevOps the shit out of it ("Martian" Science Meme)

### Forgiveness

* This is not entirely your fault
* Give yourself some grace
* Reach out to a friend
* Accept who you are
* This will get better

### Moving Forward

* Keep yourself organized
* Realize that you need to be able to communicate effectively what's happening to you and what you're going through
* Find habits that genuinely bring you peace
* Let go of your fears

## Notes and Anecdotes

* How many of you have weighed leaving a certification course at lunch because you were in so much pain?
* How many of you didn't end up leaving because you realized you didn't have enough pain meds to not make you feel guilty about laying in bed all afternoon?
