**Note:** This cult keeps changing its branding, naming, and other public-facing names due to my work here. As a result, any time I poke this content, I update it with whatever I can find. Feel free to [Contact Me](/contact/) if you'd like to share your stories or help me update this page confidentially.

## Introduction

{{< carbon >}}

In the late 1980s, my biological mother left my father to join a cult in Boomer, North Carolina. She married another cult member shortly after. When the cult moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, we moved with it. When they went to build a new house, we lived on the cult's campus for the better part of my 6th-grade year. They later built their neighborhood (Mystic Glen) in Walkertown, North Carolina, the last residence I occupied with my biological mother.

In 1993, by North Carolina law, children 13 years or older could choose the parent they wanted to live with; I moved in with my biological father in Ocala, Florida, on my 13th birthday. My biological mother no longer had a choice or the moral argument needed for any custody case. We later moved to Hendersonville, North Carolina (for the second time in my life). I severed ties with my biological mother in 1995. I later moved to Hickory, North Carolina. I saw her again in 1998, and she didn't recognize me. In 1999, I joined the US Air Force. In 2000, I made a promise to myself I would never see her alive again.

In 2005, while I was moving from one assignment to another, my mother made yet another fruitless attempt to reach out to me. But this time was different. I wasn't overseas, in the middle of national security work, or an exercise. I was guiding movers as they packed up everything. By the time they started loading the moving truck, I had my plan laid out for the response my biological mother never saw coming.

What followed is six articles (one later removed for personal reasons) that laid out my and others' arguments as to why the cult my biological mother forced me into was indeed a cult.

As of 2025-01-01, I know my mother lives/lived at Sugar Valley Airport in Davie County, North Carolina. One of my step-sisters, Lee W. Kosub, played in the [Civil Air Patrol based there](https://sugarvalley.cap.gov/). Lee W. Kosub is now the signatory on the cult's financial statements.

## The cult with many names

As many already know, there is a cult in ~~Winston-Salem~~ Mocksville, North Carolina, that has been deceiving people and ruining families for dozens of years called ~~Human Service Alliance~~ ~~Center for Purposeful Living~~ ~~Foundation for Purposeful Living~~ **Allied Wisdom Foundation**. 

Regardless of whatever they've changed their name to, this cult has done irreparable harm to several families and numerous people across the globe. In 2005, I started a series of articles that detailed the acts of those at Allied Wisdom Foundation.

I welcome anyone willing to share their stories to contact me so that I may share (anonymously if you'd wish) your trials and tribulations with the Allied Wisdom Foundation and an ever-growing group of individuals hurt by this cult. These writings aim to inform the world about the activities of the cult known as Allied Wisdom Foundation.
