## 3C2X1 Specialty Summary

Monitors and controls performance of networks and communications-computer systems (C-CS). Coordinates their configuration, operation, restoration, and service improvements. Analyzes their capabilities and performance, identifies problems, and takes corrective action. Directs and makes operational adjustments to C-CS equipment.

A skill level replaces the "X" in 3C2X1. Skill levels should be viewed as one's ability or aptitude to perform their job. Air Force wide skill levels are 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. 1 is a helper (no badge is worn on uniform), 3 is an apprentice (badge appearing on top is worn), 5 is a journeyman (badge appearing on top is worn), 7 is a craftsman (badge shown in the middle is worn), and 9 is a superintendent (the badge on the bottom is worn).

There is a lot involved in obtaining each skill level but essentially as a 1 and a 3 level you're in a constant state of training. This training could be technical school(s) (located at Keesler AFB, MS), On-the-Job Training (OJT), Computer Based Training (CBTs), and studying Career Development Courses (CDCs) all the while being certified on various tasks. When all objectives of training are complete and the right rank is held an Airman can be awarded the next skill level.

## airforce.com's take on a 3C2X1

In this day and age, it is important to establish reliable communications links for military personnel, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the president. As a communications/Computer Systems Control Apprentice, you will ensure quality service for military information systems worldwide. You will be involved in controlling all types of communications circuitry and information systems - voice, data and computer systems used for both local and long distance information exchange.

You will also work with fixed station, tactical and strategic command and control communications. You will be trained to monitor and analyze the performance of electronic fundamentals, state-of-the-art electronic and computer equipment, computer processed communications, systems, networks and circuits.

## Tech Control in a Nutshell

In a nut shell, a tech controller maintains trunks and circuits that traverse his or her tech control facility. These trunks could ride ATM, satellites, multiplexers, or a number of other available topologies that a tech control facility may contain or connect to. The trunks could contain anything from standard phone lines all the way up to classified UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) video footage circuits.

There is really no limit to what kind of communications a tech controller will deal with in any given tech control facility (TCF). A tech controller is commonly required to know a wealth of information about anything that their communications systems touch. Knowing a little about everything is a key to being a good tech controller. This is why tech controllers are referred to as "water walkers". Tech control (3C2X1) is a demanding career field requiring a lot of training but it also has numerous rewards.

## Equipment 3C2X1's (Tech Controllers) Work With
