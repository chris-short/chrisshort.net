## Abstract

Unless you're NASA, the military, or are in healthcare I'd bet, no one dies when production goes down. Adopting practices from the military or NASA could be doing more harm than good. In this talk, we'll go over what NASA and the military do to be so effective at incident response and management.

## Description

Numerous talks have described how NASA, the US military, and countless other entities respond to incidents. These are good examples but, there are specific instances they're used and they might be harmful to your organization if done poorly. There is one thing all these organization do have that yours can adopt to be more effective though: Communication. In this talk, we'll dive into experiences in incident response during my time in the USAF and how to implement better communication in your organization.
