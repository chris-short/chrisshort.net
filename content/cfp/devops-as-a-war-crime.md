## Abstract

Over the past 500 years, there have been 16 cases of a rising power threatening to displace a ruling power. 75% of those cases resulted in war. Although your organizational transformation probably won't lead to war, it could be contentious. History can help can prevent conflict when driving change.

## Description

DevOps needs to focus on more than Dev and Ops to be truly transformative for an organization. What about your security folks? What about your network team? We'll introduce the work of Thucydides and the concept of Thucydides's Trap, a political scientist's take on how rising and established powers are destined for conflict. Transformations can often be contentious and sometimes rebellious. History can actually help us avoid failure in our transformations. The more the merrier along this journey!

### Thucydides

* c.â€‰460 â€“ c.â€‰400 BC
* Athenian historian and general
* *History of the Peloponnesian War* (fifth-century BC war between Sparta and Athens)
* "Father of Scientific History"
* "Father of the school of political realism"
    * "political behavior of individuals and the subsequent outcomes of relations between states as ultimately mediated by and constructed upon the emotions of fear and self-interest."
    * "It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable."

### Allison Graham

* American political scientist
* Professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
* US national security and defense policy analyst
* Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service recipient

### Thucydides Trap

* Allison coined "Thucydides Trap"
* "Thucydides's Trap refers to the natural, inevitable discombobulation that occurs when a rising power threatens to displace a ruling power. This can happen in any sphere."
* "Intentions aside, when a rising power threatens to displace a ruling power, the resulting structural stress makes a violent clash the rule, not the exception."
* "Over the past five hundred years, in sixteen cases a major rising power has threatened to displace a ruling power. In twelve of those, the result was war. The four cases that avoided this outcome did so only because of huge, painful adjustments in attitudes and actions on the part of challenger and challenged alike."

### Dev and Ops

* The divide here is nearly closed
* Only the outliers remain (aka not Silicon Valley)
* DevOps is happening; [the US nuclear weapons program is adopting DevOps and Agile](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=2482d620e399c5fd667a8e4d059cc9ec&tab=core&_cview=0)
* Your organization has no excuse; That won't work HERE is malarkey; sorry, not sorry

### What About Networking?

* Great you can deploy code and "infrastructure" on commit
* Multiple releases a week/day/hour/minute
* What happens when you need more hardware? Eek!
* Network Engineers are awesome at VLANs, subnets, NAT, VPNs, etc. 
    * That's VPC in a nutshell!
* Imagine if your network team could automate and iterate as fast as the rest of your organization
* Bring your network team into your DevOps transformation it will reduce conflict and alienation

### What About Security?

* If your security organization is the group of no you're going to have a bad time.
* Look to leadership to help bring them on board if need be
* Shift security left
    * Running pentesting in the pipeline
    * Routinely scan source code for vulnerabilities
    * Vulnerability scanning as a commit-hook
* DevSecOps

### DevOps Isn't Just for IT

* Being lowercase agile as an organization requires more than just development and operations, right?
* C-Suite, Marketing, Legal, Sales, Finance, etc. can all help

### Change and Failing Fast

* Humans resist change
* We inherrently value success
* Different isn't always bad
* Figuring out a dud early is better than dumping millions into a failure
* "Throwing good money after bad"
* Celebrate failures AND successes
