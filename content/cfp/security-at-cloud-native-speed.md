## Abstract

Cloud native technologies are increasingly used by organizations to provide a competitive advantage. Containers and Kubernetes jumpstart developer productivity but, they could increase security teams' workloads. Threat vectors span cloud providers, control planes, developer tooling, and applications in environment hybrid environments. Use these technologies and cultures to improve security and reduce blast radius while improving velocity. This talk will analyze human tendencies and provide tips to improve security postures in cloud native environments.

## Description

Security needs to be a step in every part of the software development lifecycle. But, the tools, libraries, platforms, and attack surface never seems to shrink. When teams adopt Kubernetes and cloud native tooling, applications become epehemeral and infrastructure becomes elastic. Baking security tooling into the pipeline is critical. Mandating rigid boundaries around decoupled components is key. Embracing speed and collaboration are crucial to security teams in today's cloud native landscape. The more the merrier along this journey!

What have we done?!?!

### How fast is this thing going

* "[T]he number of containers that are alive for 10 seconds or less has doubled to 22%."

### Big Number

73% of all containers live for thirty minutes OR LESS.

### You don't stand a chance

* Attackers know this too
* Shodan and Google are available to everyone
* Vulnerable software is the expectation now

### Embrace Velocity

* High performing teams deploy multiple times a day
* Lead times are less than a day
* Service restorations happen in less than an hour
* Change failure rates are between 0-15%
