## Panel Discussion: Marketing as Code: How to Rock Out with Non-Code Contributions — KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2021

Date: 2021-10-23  
[**Watch Now**](/videos/kcna-2021-panel/)

> For new folks in the CNCF space, becoming a contributor may sound daunting, and even overwhelming. But guess what? There are tons of ways to contribute apart from code. 5 members of the Contibex Marketing working group (Kunal, Bart, Chris, Kaslin, and Matt) are all participating and contributing through positive attitudes, documentation, networking, videos, drawings, and even raps. They want to share the welcoming spirit of the CNCF where no contribution is too small, and everyone will have something to share. Contributors' stories must be heard, and that's where the upstream marketing team comes in. (This proposal is for the Students' track)

## How You Can Tell Your Kubernetes Contributor Story with These Tips - Matt Broberg & Chris Short, Red Hat; Kaslin Fields, Google; Peeyush Gupta, DigitalOcean — KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2021

Date: 2021-05-07  
[**Watch Now**](/videos/kceu-2021-panel/)

> The Upstream Marketing Working Group began as a vision to connect contributors. It has grown into a set of practices, channels, and bots that unite us all across the Kubernetes community. In this talk, contributors will walk through their experience of learning to tell their own contributor story. In doing so, we will walk through how anyone can write a great story, including key takeaways around narrative, call to action (CTA), structure, and available channels. Along the way, we'll highlight tips to publish a blog, including collaboration with the Blog team, asking for reviewers from Upstream Marketing, and a brief look at relevant SEO practices. Attendees will leave with a formula by which they can share their story of contributing to Kubernetes and encourage others to share their unique and personal experience. Our goal is to inspire the next generation of open source contributors through a broad range of perspectives on what it means to contribute.

## Security at Cloud Native Speed — CNCF Eastern Canadian Meetup: October 2020

Date: 2020-10-23  
[**Watch Now**](/videos/security-cloud-native-speed-cncf-eastern-canada-meetup-oct-2020)

> Cloud native technologies are increasingly used by organizations to gain a competitive advantage. Containers jumpstart developer productivity, but they could increase security teams' workloads. This talk analyzed tendencies and provides tips improving security postures in environments. Security needs to be a step in every part of the software development lifecycle. But, the tools, libraries, platforms, and attack surface never seems to shrink. When teams adopt Kubernetes and cloud native tooling, applications become ephemeral and infrastructure becomes elastic. Baking security tooling into the pipeline is critical. Mandating rigid boundaries around decoupled components is key. Embracing speed and collaboration are crucial to security teams in today's cloud native landscape. The more the merrier along this journey!

## DevOps is Not War — DevOpsDays Detroit 2019

Date: 2019-10-23  
[**Watch Now**](/videos/devops-not-war-detroit/)

> Over the past 500 years, there have been 16 cases of a rising power threatening to displace a ruling power. 75% of those cases resulted in war. Although your organizational transformation probably won't lead to war, it could be contentious. History can help prevent conflict when driving change. This talk will analyze human tendencies, historical data, and provide real-world examples of how to avoid conflict during your DevOps journey.

[**Watch Now**](/videos/dark-side-of-devops-jfrog-swampup-2019/)

> People think that DevOps, Cloud Native, Agile, GROWS, etc. are all rainbows and roses. You start small, work your way up or you decide as an organizational unit to change.
>
> These are two patterns associated with a Jedi-type maturation process of DevOps. Like in Star Wars, DevOps has a dark side.
>
> This talk by Chris Short of Red Hat provides examples of successful and failed DevOps transformations, as well as some lessons learned along the way.
