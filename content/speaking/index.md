### Burnout++ Cloud Native Rejekts EU 2024

A deep dive into what burnout is, how to assess or measure it, and stories on coping and managing the **burnout** from my own real life experiences.

Date: 2024-03-17

[**Watch Now**](/video/cloud-native-rejeckts-eu-2024-burnout-plus-plus)

### Burnout++ DevOpsDays Detroit 2023

My latest [CFP](/abstracts/) is about **burnout**. Burnout can happen at any point in everyone's career. But, what happens when burnout is taking place amongst other things? Contributing to open source becoming harder for you? Becoming unemployed? Your s/o having a miscarriage? Veteran dealing with time in service and injuries from it? Let's discuss realizing you're approaching or are burned out, the why behind that, and coping mechanisms.

### AWS Container Day featuring Kubernetes at KubeCon EU 2023 (Amsterdam Amazon Office)

My team at AWS was in charge of our KubeCon EU 2023 activities. Container Day was an awesome seven hour live stream (with a little bit of hybrid event chaos) all about Containers, Kubernetes, and the Cloud Native ecosystem. It was an honor to be given hosting duties alongside [Nathan Peck](https://nathanpeck.com/). It was fun to live stream again.

### Panel Discussion: Marketing as Code: How to Rock Out with Non-Code Contributions — KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2021

Date: 2021-10-23

[**Watch Now**](/video/kcna-2021-panel/)

> For new folks in the CNCF space, becoming a contributor may sound daunting, and even overwhelming. But guess what? There are tons of ways to contribute apart from code. 5 members of the Contibex Marketing working group (Kunal, Bart, Chris, Kaslin, and Matt) are all participating and contributing through positive attitudes, documentation, networking, videos, drawings, and even raps. They want to share the welcoming spirit of the CNCF where no contribution is too small, and everyone will have something to share. Contributors' stories must be heard, and that's where the upstream marketing team comes in. (This proposal is for the Students' track)

### KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Daily Wrap Up: Tuesday — KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2021

Date: 2021-10-12

[**Watch Now**](/video/kcna-2021-tuesday-wrap-up/)

> The CNCF's definitive interactive media experience for anyone wanting to learn, grow, and collaborate with others in the Cloud Native community from anywhere in the world. CloudNative.tv is currently community run shows live streaming on Twitch with a variety of hosts show casing different aspects of the cloud native community.

### How You Can Tell Your Kubernetes Contributor Story with These Tips - Matt Broberg & Chris Short, Red Hat; Kaslin Fields, Google; Peeyush Gupta, DigitalOcean — KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2021

Date: 2021-05-07

[**Watch Now**](/video/kceu-2021-panel/)

> The Upstream Marketing Working Group began as a vision to connect contributors. It has grown into a set of practices, channels, and bots that unite us all across the Kubernetes community. In this talk, contributors will walk through their experience of learning to tell their own contributor story. In doing so, we will walk through how anyone can write a great story, including key takeaways around narrative, call to action (CTA), structure, and available channels. Along the way, we'll highlight tips to publish a blog, including collaboration with the Blog team, asking for reviewers from Upstream Marketing, and a brief look at relevant SEO practices. Attendees will leave with a formula by which they can share their story of contributing to Kubernetes and encourage others to share their unique and personal experience. Our goal is to inspire the next generation of open source contributors through a broad range of perspectives on what it means to contribute.

### Security at Cloud Native Speed — CNCF Eastern Canadian Meetup: October 2020

Date: 2020-10-23

[**Watch Now**](/video/security-cloud-native-speed-cncf-eastern-canada-meetup-oct-2020)

> Cloud native technologies are increasingly used by organizations to gain a competitive advantage. Containers jumpstart developer productivity, but they could increase security teams' workloads. This talk analyzed tendencies and provides tips improving security postures in environments. Security needs to be a step in every part of the software development lifecycle. But, the tools, libraries, platforms, and attack surface never seems to shrink. When teams adopt Kubernetes and cloud native tooling, applications become ephemeral and infrastructure becomes elastic. Baking security tooling into the pipeline is critical. Mandating rigid boundaries around decoupled components is key. Embracing speed and collaboration are crucial to security teams in today's cloud native landscape. The more the merrier along this journey!

### Building Kubernetes Operators with Ansible — Red Hat® Summit Virtual Experience: Open House

Date: 2020-07-15

### DevOps is Not War — DevOpsDays Detroit 2019

Date: 2019-10-23

[**Watch Now**](/video/devops-not-war-detroit/)

> Over the past 500 years, there have been 16 cases of a rising power threatening to displace a ruling power. 75% of those cases resulted in war. Although your organizational transformation probably won't lead to war, it could be contentious. History can help prevent conflict when driving change. This talk will analyze human tendencies, historical data, and provide real-world examples of how to avoid conflict during your DevOps journey.

Event: [DevOpsDays Detroit 2019](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-detroit/welcome/)

### DevOps is Not War — DevOpsDays Raleigh 2019

Date: 2019-10-01

[**Watch Now**](/video/devops-not-war-raleigh/)

> DevOps needs to focus on more than Dev and Ops to be truly transformative for an organization. What about your security folks? What about your network team? We'll introduce the work of Thucydides and the concept of Thucydides's Trap, a political scientist's take on how rising and established powers are destined for conflict. Transformations can often be contentious and sometimes rebellious. History can actually help us avoid failure in our transformations. The more the merrier along this journey!

Event: [DevOpsDays Raleigh 2019](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-raleigh/welcome/)

### The Dark Side of DevOps — JFrog swampUP 2019

Date: 2019-06-19

[**Watch Now**](/video/dark-side-of-devops-jfrog-swampup-2019/)

> People think that DevOps, Cloud Native, Agile, GROWS, etc. are all rainbows and roses. You start small, work your way up or you decide as an organizational unit to change.
>
> These are two patterns associated with a Jedi-type maturation process of DevOps. Like in Star Wars, DevOps has a dark side.
>
> This talk by Chris Short of Red Hat provides examples of successful and failed DevOps transformations, as well as some lessons learned along the way.

Date: 2018-05-30

[**Watch Now**](/video/what-the-military-taught-me-about-devops-toronto/)

> Before DevOps was coined an entire branch of the US military was living by its core fundamentals. Visualizing work, flow, diversity, failing fast are all things that I practiced in the Air Force from 1999 to 2010. I'd like to share my lessons learned serving during this time. This talk will broaden people's view of how DevOps can be implemented, why diversity matters in DevOps, and how fortunate we all are to have the problems we have today.

### Heaven is Not a Cloud — AWS Michigan

Date: 2018-04-19

[**Watch Now**](/video/heaven-is-not-a-cloud/)

> "Migrating to the cloud saves money!" "Not running your own infrastructure reduces your bottom line!" "Lift and shift is a legitimate first step towards moving to the cloud!" These are all potential pitfalls if you're not careful. Proper planning prevents piss poor performance. Using a real chaotic cloud migration as a guide, we'll walk through the pitfalls of cloud migrations and how to avoid vendor lock-in (when it makes sense).

Date: 2018-01-19

[**Watch Now**](/video/go-to-the-rescue-devopsdays-nyc-2018/)

> If you ever need to validate certificates or certificate chains before deploying them, Golang provides a near foolproof test method.
>
> A 3rd party developed a tool that was then handed off to our DevOps team to manage and maintain. Before I could do any re-engineering work, I had to resolve a critical issue—the certificates on the ELBs were about to expire and needed updating.
>
> I assumed that if the ELB, NGINX, or httpd started, it was a good sign. This was a false assumption on my part and I ended up serving a bad chain for a few minutes. This did not break the site, but it was definitely not the way I wanted things to remain.
>
> I needed a tool that would fail if the certificate chain provided was incorrect. I wanted a lightweight tool that could be publicly accessible. Conducting a third-party analysis of the certificates and configuration was a requirement. There were no tools that I could find meeting this need, so I decided to build my own. I turned to the open source language, Golang.
>
> A detailed breakdown of how I built a tiny web server to fit my needs along with what each package is doing as detailed in the article linked above.

## Webinars

If you're looking for podcasts or webinars I've took part in, please head over to the [**Webinars**](/webinars/) page.

### Webinar: The top 7 most useful Kubernetes APIs for comprehensive cloud native observability

Date: 2020-07-09

[**Watch Now**](/video/top-seven-kubernetes-apis-for-cloud-native-observability/)

> An important early step (just after "Orchestration & Application Definition" in the CNCF trail map) in starting your cloud-native journey is picking solutions for observability, including monitoring, logging, and tracing. All of these observability tools leverage data available from Kubernetes' comprehensive APIs. Those APIs provide insights into the events that are occurring inside of the Kubernetes platform, including answers to questions like: "What's running in my Kubernetes cluster?"
>
> In this webinar, Sensu Co-founder & CEO Caleb Hailey will walk through the various Kubernetes APIs that are necessary for complete visibility into your Kubernetes platform, with examples from open source observability tools like Prometheus and Sensu. You'll gain a deeper understanding of how Kubernetes works, with a behind-the-scenes look at cloud-native observability.

### Webinar: Building Kubernetes Operators in an Ansible-native way

Date: 2019-10-09

[**Watch Now**](/video/building-kubernetes-operators-ansible-native-way/)

> Operators simplify management of complex applications on Kubernetes. They are usually written in Go and require expertise with the internals of Kubernetes. But, there's an alternative to that with a lower barrier to entry. Ansible is a first-class citizen in the Operator SDK. Using Ansible frees up application engineers, maximizes time to automate and orchestrate your applications, and doing it across new & existing platforms with one simple language. Here we see how.

### Webinar: KubeVirt - Beyond Containers: Coming full circle back to VMs!

Date: 2019-09-12

[**Watch Now**](/video/kubevirt-beyond-containers-coming-full-circle-back-to-vm/)

> In this webinar we will introduce KubeVirt and what VMs with K8s mean for you.
>
> We'll explore:
>
> 1. The architecture of KubeVirt
> 1. Key use cases where you can already take advantage of Kubevirt to manage legacy applications – Windows apps included! – alongside Kubernetes
> 1. ‘Gotchas', tricks and things to be aware of for different implementations
> 1. How KubeVirt compares with other virtualization frameworks
> 1. Future of KubeVirt, related projects, and where to start
>
> We will show a demo of an application that is comprised of VMs, Containers, an RDBMS and a LoadBalancer-type Service. We'll show how HA scenarios for legacy components are automatically handled by Kubernetes and KubeVirt, along with a couple cool surprises!

### Webinar: Monitoring Kubernetes Workloads: The Sidecar Pattern

Date: 2019-06-13

[**Watch Now**](/video/monitoring-kubernetes-workloads-sidecar-pattern/)

> Kubernetes has entirely changed the way we build our infrastructure, enabling organizations to ship more changes faster. But, with all that speed comes challenges — containers introduce a non-trivial level of complexity when it comes to maintaining visibility into your infrastructure. Just as Kubernetes has required us to rethink how we build and deploy our applications, so too must we rethink the traditional approach to monitoring.
>
> In this webinar, Sensu CEO and co-founder Caleb Hailey will review some of the existing and popular patterns for monitoring Kubernetes (like Prometheus), and what gaps remain outstanding, especially when it comes to monitoring the applications running on Kubernetes. He'll go over best practices for monitoring workloads on K8s, including the sidecar pattern for monitoring.

### Webinar: The future of how Ansible content is handled

Date: 2019-06-13

[**Watch Now**](/video/future-of-how-ansible-content-is-handled/)

> Currently, the official Ansible Engine release process is the only way for users to utilize or consume new content easily. The Ansible community has begun the journey of providing our users with more flexibility to create and consume content. In this webinar, we'll discuss where this journey started, where we are currently, and where we would like some feedback.
