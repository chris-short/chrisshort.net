> A "uses" page is a web page where individuals, particularly tech professionals and creatives, list and describe the tools, software, hardware, and gear they use in their work and daily life. It functions as a personal recommendation or "gear list," providing details on everything from a user's computer and monitor to specific applications, fonts, and peripherals. These pages are popular in the tech community as they offer insights into the setups and workflows of professionals, helping others discover useful tools and technologies.
