Video of all the GopherCon 2017 talks are now available. Fifty-eight videos in all; it's *almost* like being there. You can watch [Ashley McNamara's goosebump inducing talk](https://youtu.be/6sBBTFXOq44?list=PL2ntRZ1ySWBdD9bru6IR-_WXUgJqvrtx9), [Kris Nova's refreshing take on purging technical debt](https://youtu.be/IiYHDDz_7mE?list=PL2ntRZ1ySWBdD9bru6IR-_WXUgJqvrtx9) from [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), or [Sam Boyer's dep talk](https://youtu.be/5LtMb090AZI?list=PL2ntRZ1ySWBdD9bru6IR-_WXUgJqvrtx9).

My lightning talk, [Golang to the rescue: Saving DevOps from TLS turmoil](https://youtu.be/nIlM_HUfyw0?list=PL2ntRZ1ySWBfhRZj3BDOrKdHzoafHsKHU), is also available. Give it a watch when you have a moment.

Hats off to the organizers for getting these videos up so quickly. It feels like I just got back from Denver. The quality of the videos and the speed at which they were made available lends great credit to all involved in the production efforts.
