> Contour is an open source Kubernetes ingress controller providing the control plane for the Envoy edge and service proxy.â€‹ Contour supports dynamic configuration updates and multi-team ingress delegation out of the box while maintaining a lightweight profile.
>
> Using Contour you can quickly deploy cloud native applications, update Envoy configurations on the fly, and safely delegate ingress configuration to protect service access on multi-team Kubernetes clusters.
