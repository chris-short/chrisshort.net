> Kubernetes has entirely changed the way we build our infrastructure, enabling organizations to ship more changes faster. But, with all that speed comes challenges â€” containers introduce a non-trivial level of complexity when it comes to maintaining visibility into your infrastructure. Just as Kubernetes has required us to rethink how we build and deploy our applications, so too must we rethink the traditional approach to monitoring.
>
> In this webinar, Sensu CEO and co-founder Caleb Hailey will review some of the existing and popular patterns for monitoring Kubernetes (like Prometheus), and what gaps remain outstanding, especially when it comes to monitoring the applications running on Kubernetes. He'll go over best practices for monitoring workloads on K8s, including the sidecar pattern for monitoring.
