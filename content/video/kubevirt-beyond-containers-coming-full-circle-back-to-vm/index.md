> In this webinar we will introduce KubeVirt and what VMs with K8s mean for you.
>
> We'll explore:
>
> 1. The architecture of KubeVirt
> 1. Key use cases where you can already take advantage of Kubevirt to manage legacy applications – Windows apps included! – alongside Kubernetes
> 1. ‘Gotchas', tricks and things to be aware of for different implementations
> 1. How KubeVirt compares with other virtualization frameworks
> 1. Future of KubeVirt, related projects, and where to start
>
> We will show a demo of an application that is comprised of VMs, Containers, an RDBMS and a LoadBalancer-type Service. We'll show how HA scenarios for legacy components are automatically handled by Kubernetes and KubeVirt, along with a couple cool surprises!
