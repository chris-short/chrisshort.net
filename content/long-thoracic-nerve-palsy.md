I'm Chris Short and I have **Long Thoracic Nerve (LTN) Palsy** with **Winging of the Scapula**. On October 12, 2003, during a military hurricane evacuation exercise at Avon Park Air Force Range, I managed to permanently damage my LTN leading to winging of my right scapula.

My life has changed dramatically since I got hurt. Pain is something that I am constantly learning to live with and occasionally thrive with.

### Winging of the Scapula

According to Wikipedia, "A **winged scapula** (scapula alata) is a condition in which the shoulder blade, or shoulder bone, protrudes from a person's back in an abnormal position. It is a rare condition with the potential to lead to limited functional activity in the upper extremity with which it is adjacent. It can affect a person's ability to lift, pull, and push weighty objects."

### Long Thoracic Nerve (LTN) Palsy

The **long thoracic nerve** (LTN) is a nerve that arises from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves, descends the neck behind the brachial plexus, and is distributed to the anterior serratus muscle.

**Palsy** is a medical term derived from the word paralysis that is defined as paralysis often accompanied by loss of feeling and uncontrolled body movements such as shaking.

[wiseGEEK](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-long-thoracic-nerve-palsy.htm) provides one of the best explanations that I have found of what Long Thoracic Nerve Palsy actually is:

> Long thoracic nerve palsy is caused by injury and damage to the long thoracic nerve. This nerve runs from the neck vertebrae along the side of the chest to the muscle that holds the scapula bone to the chest wall. When this nerve is damaged, the scapula — or shoulder blade — becomes abnormally positioned, resembling a protruding wing. This odd positioning has led to the name "winged scapula." Shoulder pain and loss of movement occur as the imbalance in muscle functioning causes stress to the muscles of the shoulder.

### Pain Relief

There is not much that offers pain relief from the nerve damage itself.  The muscle in my shoulder and upper back tend to always be sore from everyday use due to the winging. But, muscle relaxers are incredibly important in keeping my pain under control. Eliminating muscle spasms leads to a better life experience overall and prevents nasty flare ups before they even start. It took ten years to realize this and hopefully others can learn from this.

#### Muscle Spasms

As of December 1, 2013 I am taking [Cyclobenzaprine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclobenzaprine) (generic Flexirl) at night and [Methocarbamol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methocarbamol) (generic Robaxin) during the day to make sure the spasticity is held at bay. At one point I was taking Baclofen, Cyclobenzaprine, and Methocarbamol during the course of the day. This combination apparently has some memory loss side effect. I was subsequently taken off the Baclofen and I could tell my short term memory was a little better.

#### Pain Killers

Narcotic pain killers have helped over the years but their side effects have also been harmful. Staying off of them is a goal that I have set but after years of taking some form of narcotic pain relievers getting off of them is a challenge. Currently, I am prescribed Tramadol to help with pain. It is not very effective unless I take it long before a potentially painful event.

#### Homeopathic Remedies

At the advice of my Pain Medicine Doctor and a chiropractor I have experimented with some herbal remedies. [Milk Thistle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silybum_marianum) is something I take to help with liver health. I take a lot of Tylenol throughout the day. The main ingredient, acetaminophen, is known to have some adverse affects on liver functions.

I also take turmeric to help with inflammation. After years of taking a variety of NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen multiple ulcers have formed in my stomach. Turmeric has been known to have anti-inflammation effects.

I also take fish oil for its joint and heart health benefits. 

#### Pulsed Radiofrequency Lesioning

While deemed "experimental" by insurance companies due to overuse, pulsed radiofrequency lesioning has provided significant pain relief to me.
