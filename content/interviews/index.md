## The 20 Best Podcasts About All Things Tech

"As mentioned in Popular Mechanics"

> The August 20, 2019 episode, "[The Infrastructure Effect: COBOL and GO](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-3/the-infrastructure-effect)" is not only fascinating, but it's relevant today. COBOL has been used for at least 60 years to support industries, and amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that hasn't changed. **Chris Short** describes how learning COBOL was seen as a safe long-term bet. *Emphasis mine*

## Red Hat's Chris Short On Redirecting A War Vet's Energy To Lifelong Learning & Technical Leadership

> Does he wish more military vets would get into DevOps? “Yes,” Short says, “but I wish the DevOps community would be more embracing of military members. I remember when I first got out I had 11 years of experience from everything from the satellite down to the laptop I had some idea of how it worked and all the software between. All that meant nothing because it said U.S. Air Force on my resume, because I wasn't from a traditional college path. Or I got the stereotype that you only know how to follow instructions or are a slightly educated monkey.”

## Command Line Heroes — The Infrastructure Effect: COBOL and Go

> Languages used for IT infrastructure don't have expiration dates. COBOL's been around for 60 years—and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. We maintain billions of lines of classic code for mainframes. But we're also building new infrastructures for the cloud in languages like Go.
>
> COBOL was a giant leap for computers to make industries more efficient. Chris Short describes how learning COBOL was seen as a safe long-term bet. Sixty years later, there are billions of lines of COBOL code that can't easily be replaced—and few specialists who know the language. Ritika Trikha explains that something must change: Either more people must learn COBOL, or the industries that rely on it have to update their codebase. Both choices are difficult. But the future isn't being written in COBOL. Today's IT infrastructure is built in the cloud—and a lot of it is written in Go. Carmen Hernández Andoh shares how Go's designers wanted a language more suited for the cloud. And Kelsey Hightower points out that languages are typically hyper-focused for one task. But they're increasingly open and flexible.
