As many already know, there is a cult in [Winston-Salem, North Carolina](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=center+for+purposeful+living&sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF8&hl=en&ll=36.114572,-80.188614&spn=0.003081,0.006974&t=h&z=18) that has been deceiving people and ruining families for dozens of years called the **Center for Purposeful Living**.  This cult was formerly known as Human Service Alliance and, at one point, University for Human Goodness.
