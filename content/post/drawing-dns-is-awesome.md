There are so many cool things about DNS one drawing is not going to do it justice. Please let this drawing serve as an inspiration to learn more about DNS.

![DNS is AWESOME](https://cdn.chrisshort.net/drawings/DNS-is-AWESOME.png)

DNS is awesome because it allows you to have a full blown CDN for next to nothing. All you have to do is create a [CNAME that points to Amazon S3](/low-cost-content-delivery-network-cdn/) or Google Storage.

If you are interested in monitoring your DNS records I would highly recommend [dnsspy.io](https://dnsspy.io/).
