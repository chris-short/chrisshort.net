There's a metaphor out there that if you say, are asked, or explain something more than three times, you should write about it since we've started [OpenShift.tv](https://openshift.tv), I cannot count how many times folks ask about my setup.

I've wanted to write this article since last October. But, things hadn't stabilized. For example, I've broken about half a dozen mic arms since May 2020 (of ALL price ranges). I also knew I would be moving operations from our unfinished basement up two stories to our guest bedroom (now my office). I wanted to make sure the setup was durable. I've proven it's portable as I've helped produce remote meetings for my son Max's school. But now is the time to write this up. Why? Because I tweeted this week.

I'll explain the reasoning for each purchase and any accessories that I found necessary as well. I will also mention neat bonuses that I added to make things more functional.

Let's start from the foundation up!

## Desk

[Fully Jarvis Powdercoated Standing Desk (72")](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks.html)  
Why Fully? They're a [certified B-Corp](https://www.fully.com/b-corp). The powder coated top that I have isn't available anymore; I understand why. It's a brittle finish. If exposed to heat (from a fresh carafe of coffee, for example), the surface bubbles **permanently**. It scratches easily too. But, that is easily hidden with a [Sharpie](https://amzn.to/3661IZM). I bought a [desk pad](https://amzn.to/3c2wx55) and [silicon pot holders](https://amzn.to/3oaSIZw) to protect the desk's surface. The top's material and width should be something you decide on for yourself based on your needs. I bought the 72" wide version (an enormous desk length) because I have a 78" wingspan. I have room for a ton of gear, as evidenced in the picture in the [tweet](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1352290404239101953).

Bonus: I bought wheels and a [wire management kit](https://www.fully.com/accessories/wire-management-kit.html) from Fully for the desk to make it easy to move. When I was in the unfinished basement on a concrete floor, I could wheel the desk to any position or spot in the basement to make for a better experience (or make coffee). You never saw this on OpenShift.tv, but you better believe I've made coffee during meetings or put myself in front of the windows to soak in some sunlight during internal or community meetings. Couple the wheels with an [APC Surge Protector with Extension Cord](https://amzn.to/3qDgS0i), and you have a lot of possible configurations if you have a big enough space. One thing to keep in mind is that this means you need to have everything attached to or on the desk itself. I used to have my subwoofer on the floor; I couldn't wheel the desk around much then.

Also, the [Jarvis Magnetic Desk Hooks](https://www.fully.com/jarvis-desk-hooks.html) from Fully are *amazing*. I have them in a lot of places around my office. When I'm standing at the desk, I use a [Topo Anti-Fatigue Mat](https://www.fully.com/accessories/jarvis-accessories/topo-standing-mat.html) to keep some joints from fatiguing too quickly. I make a conscious effort not to go from standing to sitting or vice versa during meetings or live streams. I've been told this is disorienting and can sometimes place things in the frame that folks may not appreciate (your crotch, for example).
