This is by no means a complete history of Linux and is very much a work in progress. However, it's a very extensive combination of information from usenet posts and Linux authority sites.

1971  
Bell Labs releases the first Unix operating system.

1985  
Richard Stallman releases his GNU (aka "GNU is Not Unix") [Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html) thus starting the open source revolution. He wanted to create an open-source version of Unix. Stallman's [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/) eventually created the GNU General Public License (GPL) which is basically an anti-copyright also referred to as a "copyleft".
