Microsoft announced on Sunday that it would share Microsoft Office 2003 source code as part of the [Microsoft Government Security Program](https://news.microsoft.com/2003/01/14/microsoft-announces-government-security-program/). The program is designed to make governments feel more comfortable about Microsoft's security practices. The source code for Office 2003 is going to be shared with the governments of more than 30 countries.

I'm sure the United States will have numerous teams from different agencies analyzing this source code. It will be interesting to see what the NSA has to say about it. Something I'm curious about is if a government finds a blatant security flaw of some sort are they to fix the flaw themselves or is Microsoft the only person allowed to manipulate the code? I'm Microsoft isn't going to want to have over 30 different versions of Office 2003 out there but it sure would be nice to strip out the Excel game and all of the other non-sense incorporated into Office in an effort to speed things up and make it more secure.

This Microsoft program is probably loaded with restrictions but it will be interesting to see how many more holes or problems are found with Microsoft's products.
