I have to say that I was not too enthusiastic about [Wii Sports Resort](https://amzn.to/2Zb2oGO) when its release was announced. What intrigued me, obviously, was the addition of the Wii MotionPlus functionality. Wii Sports Resort is essentially Wii Sports 2 with a resort/spa theme.

All sports activities take place on an island which is explorable by plane (which I do enjoy).  The added gyroscopes and spatial awareness added by the Wii MotionPlus accessory is pretty awesome.

There are 12 games inside Wii Sports Resort that all have great playability (minus the Frisbee games).  The games are as followed:

* Swordplay
* Wakeboarding
* Frisbee
* Archery
* Basketball
* Table Tennis
* Golf
* Bowling
* Power Cruising
* Canoeing
* Cycling
* Air Sports

The Frisbee games are exceedingly difficult to get to work in Automatic mode (automatic being that it senses when you want to release the Frisbee as opposed to you using a button) but are entertaining when you get the hang of it.

The Basketball games are not for those that actually play.  Think of it as a guitar master playing Rock Band, you will likely have to develop two sets of skills.  I like to think I have a very pretty jump shot (at least I was complemented on it when I played) but, Wii Sports Resort "ain't having" my Glen Rice modeled game.  It likes a nice simple, ugly wrist snap motion mixed in with a little bit of good timing.  The 3-on-3 game also leaves something to be desired but it is decent enough.

The Archery game is quite impressive.  You must factor in wind, timing, and your hands have to be that of a shooter.  There is no limit to the complexity of every shot in every difficulty setting.  Timing is key; patience is a virtue.

Overall, I really enjoy Wii Sports Resort, but, in small doses.  To accommodate for that I recommend changing between the 12 games frequently.

On a scale of 1 to 10 I give Wii Sports Resort a 7.
