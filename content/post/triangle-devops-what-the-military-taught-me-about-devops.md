I had the opportunity to present [What The Military Taught Me About DevOps](/what-the-military-taught-me-about-devops/) at the [Triangle DevOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-DevOps/events/235751024/) last night. It was a fantastic group of people and I fielded a lot of great feedback after speaking.

One person asked if I would be willing to share my slides. I informed him that they were already shared but I think the [notes that accompany the slides](https://cdn.chrisshort.net/What%20the%20Military%20Taught%20Me%20About%20DevOps.pdf) are important to share too:

One takeaway I have from the talk, is that I need to get better at speaking on diversity issues. But, that is for another time.

I think this will be the last time I give this talk (for a while at least). But, if you are interested in me speaking about veterans and/or tech issues do not hesitate to ask.
