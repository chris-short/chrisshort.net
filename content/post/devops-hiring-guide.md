The [opensource.com DevOps Community](https://opensource.com/devops-team) and [The Enterprisers Project](https://enterprisersproject.com/) teamed up to create the quintessential guide to hiring for DevOps talent. I contributed the Introduction and the article, "DevOps hiring strategies to attract top talent". This was a significant amount of work from all parties and I love how quickly and beautifully it came together. Hats off to Jason Hibbets and the folks at Red Hat that helped put this together.

To discuss attracting talent I brough in a fantastic recruiter to bounce questions off of; [Ken M. Middleton](https://kenmmiddleton.com/). I met Ken during [my job search last year](/leaving-bankrate/). He's a pretty awesome person and one of the only recruiters I can legitimately recommend for DevOps folks.
