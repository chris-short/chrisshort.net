Following the metaphor that you should write about it if you say, are asked, or explain something more than three times...

Following me on social media can be very helpful if you want a stream or the occasional burst of tech and industry related content that is being considered that week for the [DevOps'ish newsletter](https://devopsish.com/). I curate DevOps'ish by hand but, I get a little help by sharing the news I'm reading with a wider audience. With that being said, my social feeds can be a lot at times (as I've been told).

At the time of writing, the news stream is a minimum of 25 posts a day. What can I say, weeks like last week, for example, when there's a lot of tech news across the full spectrum of governance, culture, technical works, and new tools, I end up doing a lot of reading and sharing.

When weeks are really busy, news piles up, and I will increase the flow of the news stream to clear the log jam. I usually try to target busier activity times on the US east coast but, that could make for an awkward evening news feed if you're in points east of Detroit.

So here's what you can do to turn off the news stream, but still keep up with me on Twitter, LinkedIn, or wherever you might be following me.

First, if you want the news stream to be something you can go look at on demand, I'd encourage you to join the [DevOps'ish subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsish/). Yes, reddit's algorithms apply but, all the news throughout the week lands there. I'd love to have the time to maintain an independent community but, that's not in the cards at the time of writing.

If you're not a reddit fan (I get it), you can always catch up at your own pace on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23devopsish)%20(from%3AChrisShort)) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=devopsish). Those networks' algorithms will always be in play though, please keep that in mind.

Now that you have your on demand access to the news stream, you can safely filter out some things to keep the social feeds to just the things I intentionally write or share by hand (artisanal posts, y'all... not really).

You can either filter on the `#devopsish` hashtag or the `Recommended Read:` syntax. However you do your filtering, either of these methods will safely stem the onslaught that is the DevOps'ish news stream.

I don't know at what number of people you follow where the news stream more naturally fits into your social media consumption without inundating it. But, I would say it's well above 1,000 accounts you're following. I could be totally wrong too.

The social network algorithms are always being tweaked. But, there's a way to stop my news stream without unfollowing me.
