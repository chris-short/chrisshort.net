In March 2017, I had a Twitter chat with [Brian Ketelsen](https://www.brianketelsen.com/) about getting started with [**Go**](http://golang.org/). I demonstrated what I knew from my decades of systems experience to give him an idea of my skill level. He graciously recommended I pick up a copy of [Go in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action) (which I happily did).

As learning Go in 2017 is my first real foray into attempting to deeply learn a programming language I was saddened to read this text in the beginning of the book:

>"This book was written for an intermediate-level developer who has some experience with other programming languages and wants to learn Go."

Like every other time I picked up a programming book (dating back to 1996), I felt like I was already behind the power curve. I recently realized that I am not even a remotely good hacker because I do not have the basic computer science fundamentals. Tell me what something is and I can connect it to something I likely already knew. Tell me a type won't work in this scenario and I will be lost.

This is my attempt at note taking and connecting dots along my way in the journey to learning Go. If I look up a term it will go here in the order I looked it up. Any associated terms or concepts I have to look up as a result of the initial search will be associated with the original term. Hopefully, this will turn into something useful in the future.

**Concurrency**: decomposability property of a program, algorithm, or problem into order-independent or partially-ordered components or units. In layman's terms, it's the ability for a series of operations to be completed (semi)independently.
