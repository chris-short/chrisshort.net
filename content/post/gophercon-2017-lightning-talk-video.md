Video of all the GopherCon 2017 talks are now available. Fifty-eight videos in all; it's *almost* like being there. You can watch [Ashley McNamara's goosebump inducing talk](https://youtu.be/6sBBTFXOq44?list=PL2ntRZ1ySWBdD9bru6IR-_WXUgJqvrtx9), [Kris Nova's refreshing take on purging technical debt](https://youtu.be/IiYHDDz_7mE?list=PL2ntRZ1ySWBdD9bru6IR-_WXUgJqvrtx9) from [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), or [Sam Boyer's dep talk](https://youtu.be/5LtMb090AZI?list=PL2ntRZ1ySWBdD9bru6IR-_WXUgJqvrtx9).

My lightning talk, [Golang to the rescue: Saving DevOps from TLS turmoil](https://youtu.be/nIlM_HUfyw0?list=PL2ntRZ1ySWBfhRZj3BDOrKdHzoafHsKHU), is also available. Give it a watch when you have a moment. It's not my best work but, the only way to get better is to keep at it.

Hats off to the organizers for getting these videos up so quickly. It feels like I just got back from Denver. The quality of the videos and the speed at which they were made available lends great credit to all involved in the production efforts.
