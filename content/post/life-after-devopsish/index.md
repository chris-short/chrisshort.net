## How'd we get here

- Health issues
- Mounting stress of running a small business
- Risk/Reward; self-fulfillment; burdens

## Slowing Down

- Hard to believe but I have a really hard time doing nothing
- This is actually due to a mental tick of sorts; Snowden leaks
- Thoroughly enjoyed holidays (would be better if Aubree was here)
- Feed reading and social sharing changes

## Where do we go from here

- I'm reading less news and sharing less on social media (this is a healthy pattern)
- I am still working upstream on the recently renamed OmniBOR and of course Kubernetes
- I am going to try to grow the subscriber of DevOps'ish and aggressively root out spam and trolls
- I'm still on social media as indicated on chrisshort.me; feel free to ping me
