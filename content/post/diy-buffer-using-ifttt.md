[Buffer](https://buffer.com/) is a great tool for scheduling and posting content to social media. But, it costs money to do any sort of real sharing. I prefer to share more content from others than I do my own. Paying money to share other people's content is fine but not for me. I came up with an alternative that might be useful to others so here it is:

You will need a place to save links like Pocket (Instapaper or any other comparable service that interfaces with IFTTT works).

<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>  
<!-- chrisshort.net Responsive -->  
<ins class="adsbygoogle"  
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8972983586873269"
     data-ad-slot="1297095894"
     data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
<script>  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

Use a Tumblr site to control spacing out your posts throughout the day. Configure Tumblr with a queue that posts content throughout the day (I post fifteen times a day between 8 AM and 8 PM).

Connect Pocket to Tumblr with IFTTT. Your applet or recipe should add Pocket links to your Tumblr queue.

Then you will use IFTTT to post link posts (or photos if you want) to whatever social network you want. TADA!
