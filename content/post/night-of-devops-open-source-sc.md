On Tuesday, May 23, 2017, I did a DevOps talk at [Open Source South Carolina](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-South-Carolina/events/239747095/). The talk was a DevOps 101-styled deep dive into DevOps. Since the number one question I get when talking about DevOps, in general, is "where do I start?" I added my "[The Three Things](https://speakerdeck.com/chrisshort/a-night-of-devops?slide=21)" to the already well known "[Three Ways](http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/)". This provided both the holistic view while guiding people needed an extra nudge down the DevOps path.

It was a lengthy talk given the two-hour time slot. I built an [enormous outline](https://gist.github.com/chris-short/8e50511c8ff808f032a968eac41f5363) to guide myself during the talk. I am considering making the talk into an ebook when time becomes more abundant if demand is there.
