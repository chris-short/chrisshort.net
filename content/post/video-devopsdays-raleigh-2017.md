As previously mentioned, [I spoke at DevOpsDays Raleigh](/devopsdays-raleigh-2017-the-dark-side-of-devops/). It was an awesome experience organizing and participating at the event! Videos from DevOpsDays Raleigh 2017 were [recently released on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Xs0UbAdDaMRmStzhSsSag/videos). I wanted to take a moment to share the one's I was a subject in here.

The first video is from my Dark Side of DevOps talk. The second video is from Ignite Karoke the second day (which I highly recommend).
