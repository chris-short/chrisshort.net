As previously mentioned, [I spoke at DevOpsDays Raleigh](/devopsdays-raleigh-2017-the-dark-side-of-devops/). It was an awesome experience! Videos from the event were recently released and I wanted to share them here. The first video is from my Dark Side of DevOps talk. The second video is from Ignite Karoke the second day (which I highly recommend).
