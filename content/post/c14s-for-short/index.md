title: c14s for Short
---

I had a random thought pop into my head during a conversation one night so I tweeted it, "Christophernetes"

{{< tweet user="ChrisShort" id="1081398656580894720" >}}

Then Brandon Dimcheff chimed in with a very appropriate shortening, "c14s"

{{< tweet user="bdimcheff" id="1081417585575501824" >}}

Then Andy Randall chime in with what is now my display name on Twitter, "c14s for Short"

{{< tweet user="andrew_randall" id="1081614115401981953" >}}

Thank you **all** for this.
