I had a random thought pop into my head during a conversation one night so I tweeted it, "Christophernetes"

{{< twitter 1081398656580894720 >}}

Then Brandon Dimcheff chimed in with a very appropriate shortening, "c14s"

{{< twitter 1081417585575501824 >}}

Then Andy Randall chime in with what is now my display name on Twitter, "c14s for Short"

{{< twitter 1081614115401981953 >}}

Thank you all for this.
