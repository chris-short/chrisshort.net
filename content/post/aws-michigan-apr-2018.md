I recently spoke at [AWS Michigan](https://www.meetup.com/AWS-Michigan/events/248874167/) about cloud migrations. The talk wasn't AWS specific but we sure did talk about it a ton. From defining cloud to addressing priorities to preventing cost overruns we covered a lot during the meetup. I was peppered with questions by a lively audience. After speaking on stage at DevOpsDays Atlanta 2018, there was this awkward moment for me when the first question was asked. I wasn't mentally prepared for questions during the talk but, adjusted quickly.

I love doing local events. It allows me to form connections with folks that are nearby. Building those relationships are awesome both personally and professionally. There's also the bonus of sleeping in my own bed afterwards too. If you're in the Ann Arbor area and there is an [AWS Michigan](https://www.meetup.com/AWS-Michigan/) Meetup on the books, you should definitely go check it out!
