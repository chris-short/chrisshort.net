The intention of this post is to share what it's like to be live streaming on [openshift.tv](https://openshift.tv). We've been in a startup mode for about two months now. We've been on air for a little over a month. I've learned so much, I also want to share some lessons learned along the way.

Live streaming is a hot topic these days due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The topic has been so hot in fact that Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has done two webinars on about live streaming and using [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) (OBS):

* [CNCF Community Webinar: How to Conduct a GREAT Live Stream](https://www.cncf.io/webinars/cncf-community-webinar-how-to-conduct-a-great-live-stream/): There's a whole backstory on how this came together. Long story short, huge shoutout to [Jorge Castro](https://twitter.com/castrojo) and [Alex Lustenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alustenberg/).
* [CNCF Community Webinar: How to conduct a great livestream - Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) deep dive](https://www.cncf.io/webinars/how-to-conduct-a-great-livestream-open-broadcaster-softwareobs-deep-dive/)

There are now *#streaming* channels in the [CNCF Slack](https://cncf.slack.com/), my work Slack(s), and other internal chat applications. All these channels have people asking questions from how to get started to how to get the right Keyframe Interval. I'm now a user and somewhat of a fan of [Discord](https://discord.com/). I've had to ask the [OBS Community](https://discord.com/invite/obsproject) if something I was experiencing was a bug, unexpected behavior, or a scenario not even thought of. That's right, some of the tooling in the space is so new that I've found instances where teams have said things along the lines of, "Oh, we didn't think of that. We'll add it to the roadmap." Live streaming is a pretty bleeding edge space and i**t's awesome to be a part of it**. I've found a way to connect with folks in real time, face to face, right from my desk. I've wanted this for a long time.

When my team, with me leading the efforts, started down this path we knew we wanted to keep things as simple and open as possible. For the first month and a half I have had to wear multiple hats as I've juggled a number of roles; producer, host, showrunner, project management, marketing, etc. As my boss puts it, "We're in startup mode." It really is an delightful experience seeing live streaming bringing some good indicators of success too.
