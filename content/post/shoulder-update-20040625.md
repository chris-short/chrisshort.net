The Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Study yesterday was a somewhat painful experience but it proved that I don't have any permanent nerve damage.

I have to wait until after the 4th to talk to my doctor (he's on leave and no one else picked up for him). I did talk to my doctor's technician and she assured me that my doctor will contact me on the 6th.
