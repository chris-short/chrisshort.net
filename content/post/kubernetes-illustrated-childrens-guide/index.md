From the original [The Illustrated Children's Guide to Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/06/illustrated-childrens-guide-to-kubernetes/) blog post:

> Meet Phippy–the intrepid little PHP app–and her journey to Kubernetes. What better way to talk to your parents, friends, and co-workers about this Kubernetes thing you keep going on about, than a little story time. We give to you The Illustrated Children's Guide to Kubernetes, conceived of and narrated by our own Matt Butcher and lovingly illustrated by Bailey Beougher.

When I first got a copy of The Illustrated Children's Guide to Kubernetes at an event in 2016 I knew what Kubernetes was and that it was going to be a big deal. But, I hadn't quite grasp the understanding of all the various components. The Illustrated Children's Guide to Kubernetes helped me understand the basics of Kubernetes and where to dive in deeper. Also, it made my son, Max, giggle quite a bit when I read it to him.
