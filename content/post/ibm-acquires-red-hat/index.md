Since Sunday afternoon I've been in a whirlwind of meetings, discussions, and calls regarding IBM and its planned acquisition of Red Hat for $34 billion dollars. My mind has been racing but, after some consideration I've decided to share my thoughts as a sort of narrative timeline.

## "At least it wasn't Oracle"

On Sunday, October 29, 2018 I was watching my two older nephews play with Max at my youngest nephew's baptism party when a Bloomberg alert popped up. My phone was on a coffee table, while I could make out that the alert was Bloomberg I couldn't read what it said. "Bloomberg? On a Sunday? Huh." I thought to myself. Picking up the phone I immediately notice it says something about Red Hat. Reading quickly I see the headline, [IBM to Acquire Linux Distributor Red Hat for $33.4 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-28/ibm-is-said-to-near-deal-to-acquire-software-maker-red-hat).

I opened the story, skimmed it, and got up to go find my wife, Julie. I show her the story. Julie knows IBM from living in Raleigh for a decade (not a good decade for IBM either). I don't recall exactly what she said or did but, it made me start looking for additional information. While opening Inoreader an alert from Reuters came in, [IBM nears deal to acquire cyber security company Red Hat: sources](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-red-hat-m-a-ibm/ibm-nears-deal-to-acquire-cyber-security-company-red-hat-sources-idUSKCN1N20N3).

I opened Gmail so I could see what Red Hat's stream of consciousness (aka memo-list) is saying. I was surprised to not see much activity (only four e-mails basically wondering if it's a hoax). Then Business Insider broke their story, [IT'S OFFICIAL: IBM is acquiring software company Red Hat for $34 billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-is-reportedly-nearing-a-deal-to-acquire-redhat-the-software-company-valued-at-20-billion-2018-10).

It was an odd feeling. Like, maybe I could have said something knowing it wouldn't have mattered. It was a sensation of not even getting a chance to do something. In the span of 24 minutes I went from having a pretty great day to having what was akin to a panic attack.

"I have to get home," I thought to myself. I made a hasty goodbye to the family and walk out the door. I sent the [IBM press release](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-10-28-IBM-To-Acquire-Red-Hat-Completely-Changing-The-Cloud-Landscape-And-Becoming-Worlds-1-Hybrid-Cloud-Provider) to my boss to make sure she knew. I didn't know why I was driving home but, home was also the office and it felt like the right thing to do. If push came to shove I could get people up to speed as they popped up online.

The drive home was filled with nausea and worry. "I should get home and go straight down to the office and login," I think. My boss texts back, "Holy Shit!" I get home to a lot of notifications. My boss and I go back and forth for a minute vis text as I'm walking inside. But, basically there wasn't much to be done. I took some anxiety meds and laid face down for a little bit on my bed.

A friend at Red Hat texts me asking if I'd seen the news. I responded back that I had and wasn't feeling to great about it. You have to understand my experience with IBM. In 2015, I worked for a few weeks at healthcare company that was a $1 billion dollar IBM acquisition. It was a total dumpster fire and IBM knew it. But, Watson Health was the future of IBM, a friend elsewhere in IBM had told me. Long story short, I saw a ton of cracks in the business that was just bought for a ridiculous sum of money. I had to make a decision real quick and got out of Dodge. Earlier this year, [IBM's Watson Health had huge layoffs](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/25/ibms_watson_layoffs/) and I felt very justified in my decision. My rash decision making might have hurt my career a little. But, I dodged a huge bullet in my first run in as an almost IBM employee. At the end of the brief discussion with my friend he said, "**At least it wasnt Oracle.**" My response, "Yes... I really would have driven off the road then."

## Monday Morning Quarterbacking

memo-list was a dumpster fire. I stopped looking at it altogether. 

## Conclusion

Make no mistake, this is a historic moment. Whether it's the beginning or the end of a history is the big question.
