Since Sunday afternoon I've been in a whirlwind of meetings, discussions, and calls regarding IBM and its planned acquisition of Red Hat for $34 billion dollars. My mind has been racing but, after some consideration I've decided to share my thoughts as a sort of narrative timeline. Trust me when say that I have given this format considerable thought. It is likely the safest way (regulatory-wise) to deliver my thoughts on the topic.

I would like to point out that I have updated [my disclaimer and this site's terms](/terms/). My views do not reflect those of my employer or entities I'm affiliated with.

## "At least it wasn't Oracle"

On Sunday, October 29, 2018 I was watching my two older nephews play with Max at my youngest nephew's baptism party when a Bloomberg alert popped up. My phone was on a coffee table, while I could make out that the alert was Bloomberg I couldn't read what it said. "Bloomberg? On a Sunday? Huh." I thought to myself. Picking up the phone I immediately notice it says something about Red Hat. Reading quickly I see the headline, [IBM to Acquire Linux Distributor Red Hat for $33.4 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-28/ibm-is-said-to-near-deal-to-acquire-software-maker-red-hat).

I opened the story, skimmed it, and got up to go find my wife, Julie. I show her the story. Julie knows IBM from living in Raleigh for a decade (not a good decade for IBM either). I don't recall exactly what she said or did but, it made me start looking for additional information. While opening Inoreader an alert from Reuters came in, [IBM nears deal to acquire cyber security company Red Hat: sources](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-red-hat-m-a-ibm/ibm-nears-deal-to-acquire-cyber-security-company-red-hat-sources-idUSKCN1N20N3).

I opened Gmail so I could see what Red Hat's stream of consciousness (aka memo-list) is saying. I was surprised to not see much activity (only four e-mails basically wondering if it's a hoax). Then Business Insider broke their story, [IT'S OFFICIAL: IBM is acquiring software company Red Hat for $34 billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-is-reportedly-nearing-a-deal-to-acquire-redhat-the-software-company-valued-at-20-billion-2018-10).

It was an odd feeling. Like, maybe I could have said something knowing it wouldn't have mattered. It was a sensation of not even getting a chance to do something. In the span of 24 minutes I went from having a pretty great day to having what was akin to a panic attack.

"I have to get home," I thought to myself. I made a hasty goodbye to the family and walk out the door. I sent the [IBM press release](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-10-28-IBM-To-Acquire-Red-Hat-Completely-Changing-The-Cloud-Landscape-And-Becoming-Worlds-1-Hybrid-Cloud-Provider) to my boss to make sure she knew. I didn't know why I was driving home but, home was also the office and it felt like the right thing to do. If push came to shove I could get people up to speed as they popped up online.

The drive home was filled with nausea and worry. "I should get home and go straight down to the office and login," I think. My boss texts back, "Holy Shit!" I get home to a lot of notifications. My boss and I go back and forth for a minute vis text as I'm walking inside. But, basically there wasn't much to be done. I took some anxiety meds and laid face down for a little bit on my bed.

A friend at Red Hat texts me asking if I'd seen the news. I responded back that I had and wasn't feeling to great about it. You have to understand my experience with IBM. In 2015, I worked for a few weeks at healthcare company that was a $1 billion dollar IBM acquisition. It was a total dumpster fire and IBM knew it. But, Watson Health was the future of IBM, a friend elsewhere in IBM had told me. Long story short, I saw a ton of cracks in the business that was just bought for a ridiculous sum of money. I had to make a decision real quick and got out of Dodge. Earlier this year, [IBM's Watson Health had huge layoffs](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/25/ibms_watson_layoffs/) and I felt very justified in my decision. My rash decision making might have hurt my career a little. But, I dodged a huge bullet in my first run in as an almost IBM employee. At the end of the brief discussion with my friend he said, "**At least it wasnt Oracle.**" My response, "Yes... I really would have driven off the road then."

## Monday Morning

[memo-list was a dumpster fire](https://twitter.com/cra/status/1056671662073171970). I stopped looking at it altogether overnight. Monday morning brought a slew of meeting and all-hands calendar invites. A friend who went through a gnarly acquisition at NetApp calls. He gives some sage advice that calms my nerves but doesn't completely put me at ease. It was a start though so I'm incredibly thankful for that.

The Jim Whitehurst-Ginni Rometty all hands was critically important for both Jim and Ginni to nail in front of the world. Their [CNBC Squawk Box spot](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/10/29/watch-the-full-interview-with-ibm-and-red-hat-ceos-on-33-billion-deal.html) was alright but who knew how an auditorium full of Red Hatters would respond.

Jim walks out in his familiar jeans and white button down. Ginni walks out in purple. Turns out that later on in the presentation Arvind Krishna, IBM's SVP of Hybrid Cloud and Director of Research, said he was wearing purple to show cohesion because Red Hat and IBM. Ginni said she didn't even realize she had done it. It was a very human moment.

The all hands itself was good. Ginni donning a red fedora was a very nice touch. A snarky text comes in from a friend afterwards, "Never thought I'd see the day Chris Short worked for IBM." My next all hands was with my business unit leadership. They were very open, honest, and maybe just a smidge too excited. If you're a long time Red Hatter you probably have a lot of stock that's going to vest at a nice premium (even after the acquisition news 50+ point bump). For those of us still reeling from the news itself and what the future may hold I decided to write an e-mail the BU's leadership.

> Thank you for taking the time today to talk and answer our questions. I asked flat out what my number one concern was for Red Hat and that is its people. I know that there is a large chunk of Red Hat, myself included, getting e-mails, phone calls, DMs, etc. this morning. Some of these are congratulatory, more are condolences, and others are flat out, "Are you going to be okay?"
>
> The metrics alone show this is a monumental event that could be life-changing. I'm already feeling myself become less open as a result. Contra to Red Hat policies, I am self censoring more so than I have through other acquisitions because this is IBM. I'm sharing press and stories but, I'm not commenting, at all, where normally I would. I have thoughts and opinions on the topic and I'm hesitant to discuss them as I don't know what IBM's reaction will be.
>
> Please keep in mind, IBM has been building, for a decade or more, negative thoughts in peoples minds. Their own actions have affected friends and family negatively. I know companies exist to deliver value to investors. But, we live in a very different world. Red Hat was this shining beacon of hope for people. Peoples' hopes and dreams are on uncertain footing now.
>
> Some of us now have this fear of an IBM blue washing of Red Hat. Google has shown for years that, psychological safety is important to effective teams (https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/). Being as psychologically safe at a company as I am at Red Hat has never happened to me before. It has been liberating. I don't feel safe being as open as I was last week and this is the first twelve hours. Please help folks try to feel safe through this acquisition.
>
> Last week, I told a friend I finally found a place to call home in Red Hat. That friend is now trying to recruit me away from Red Hat. As I'm sure you're painfully aware, the industry moves way faster than this acquisition ever will. Please keep that in mind
>
> Thank you for your time and leadership.

I think this e-mail captures the reality of Monday. Yes, my natural instinct to self-censor publicly was working overtime. That was likely more legalities, fear, and doubt fueling that. But, this was an emotional and raw morning. A lot of folks around Red Hat were fielding calls on Sunday evening to jump ship. I know what it's like when people are trying to lure you away. It's easy to be lured away from uncertainty (we are humans after all).

## Conclusion

Make no mistake, this is a historic moment. Whether it's the beginning or the end of a history is the big question.
