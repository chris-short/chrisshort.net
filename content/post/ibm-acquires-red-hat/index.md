Since Sunday afternoon I've been in a whirlwind of meetings, discussions, and calls regarding IBM and its planned acquisition of Red Hat for $34 billion dollars. My mind has been racing but, after some consideration I've decided to share my thoughts as a sort of narrative timeline.

## "At Least It's Not Oracle"

On Sunday, October 29, 2018 I was watching my two older nephews play with Max at my youngest nephew's baptism party when a Bloomberg alert popped up. My phone was on a coffee table, while I could make out that the alert was Bloomberg I couldn't read what it said. "Bloomberg? On a Sunday? Huh." I thought to myself. Picking up the phone I immediately notice it says something about Red Hat. Reading quickly I see the headline, [IBM to Acquire Linux Distributor Red Hat for $33.4 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-28/ibm-is-said-to-near-deal-to-acquire-software-maker-red-hat).

I opened the story, skimmed it, and got up to go find my wife, Julie. I show her the story. Julie knows IBM from living in Raleigh for a decade (not a good decade for IBM either). I don't recall exactly what she said or did but, it made me start looking for additional information. While opening Inoreader an alert from Reuters came in, [IBM nears deal to acquire cyber security company Red Hat: sources](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-red-hat-m-a-ibm/ibm-nears-deal-to-acquire-cyber-security-company-red-hat-sources-idUSKCN1N20N3).

I opened Gmail so I could see what Red Hat's stream of consciousness (aka memo-list) is saying. I was surprised to not see much activity (only four e-mails basically wondering if it's a hoax). Then Business Insider broke their story, [IT'S OFFICIAL: IBM is acquiring software company Red Hat for $34 billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-is-reportedly-nearing-a-deal-to-acquire-redhat-the-software-company-valued-at-20-billion-2018-10).

It was an odd feeling. Like, maybe I could have said something knowing it wouldn't have mattered. It was a sensation of not even getting a chance to do something. In the span of 24 minutes I went from having a pretty great day to having what was akin to a panic attack.

"I have to get home," I thought to myself. I made a hasty goodbye to the family and walk out the door. I sent the [IBM press release](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-10-28-IBM-To-Acquire-Red-Hat-Completely-Changing-The-Cloud-Landscape-And-Becoming-Worlds-1-Hybrid-Cloud-Provider) to my boss to make sure she knew. I didn't know why I was driving home but, home was also the office and it felt like the right thing to do. If push came to shove I could get people up to speed as they popped up online.

The drive home was filled with nausea and worry. "I should get home and go straight down to the office and login," I think. My boss texts back, "Holy Shit!" I get home to a lot of notifications. My boss and I go back and forth for a minute vis text as I'm walking inside. But, basically there wasn't much to be done. I took some anxiety meds and laid face down for a little bit on my bed.

## Conclusion

Make no mistake, this is a historic moment. Whether it's the beginning or the end of a history is the big question.
