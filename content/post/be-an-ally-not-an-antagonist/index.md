Being an ally to underrepresented minorities is crucial to business and industry (Tech especially) as it promotes diversity and inclusion and [inevitably leads to better decision making](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter), [quicker innovation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinsights/2020/01/15/diversity-confirmed-to-boost-innovation-and-financial-results/), and aids recruiting in both open source communities and the workplace.

**Author's Note**: There are countless resources on this topic and many studies that prove my theories here. I'm not trying to argue. I am not trying to change minds. I am sharing my learnings. When you're ready, you'll embrace these concepts.

Think of being an ally as a trust-building journey. It doesn't happen once you complete a checklist of things. It's demonstrating that you're willing to work on yourself. It takes years, and you should not expect an award at any point. You're being a good human; congrats! Seeing those around you succeed is rewarding.

Never forget you're trying to overcome a nearly insurmountable obstacle of stigmas, hate, racism, bigotry, and atrocities like slavery, followed by the overt oppression happening daily to various underrepresented minorities worldwide.

> Diversity is being invited to the party.
> Inclusion is being asked to dance.

It shouldn't surprise anyone, but the tech industry, for quite some time, has been dominated by a homogeneous group of people. What's interesting about this is that many women during the dawn of the computing era carried the title of Computer. Their jobs were to do the calculations we now hand off to sand that does the math for us (aka silicon microchips). But the homogeneous group takeover has resulted in a need for more diverse perspectives, experiences, and ideas. This lacking has led to an unnecessary higher barrier of entry for people that not only meet the technical requirements for a role but also a social requirement that is likely undocumented or your homogeneous team might not even realize.

This lack of diverse ideas is an anti-pattern for anyone doing anything in a vein remotely close to DevOps. The homogeneous group has to bring more diverse people to the table and make an environment where they will flourish. Take the initiative to research on your own. Refrain from putting the burden of teaching you on the people whom you are trying to bring into an organization or project to find out how to do this. You need to research this independently and validate your knowledge with actions.

Everyone can learn to be **more** inclusive (myself included). It's a journey, a learning opportunity like no other. You will screw up, and the first thing you should learn, from my own experience, is how to apologize authentically.

## Apologizing Authentically

> "We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak." ― Epictetus

I will admit I've fumbled some apologies before. Everyone makes mistakes. If you suddenly find that you've unintentionally given reason for someone to take umbrage towards you. These actions help you learn from your error, thus making you a better version of yourself. An effective, authentic apology will convey sincerity, understanding, and a genuine desire to make amends.

### Acknowledge your mistake

Let's start by admitting that you made a mistake. Recognize its impact on the other person. Empathize with them and their concern(s). Please take responsibility for your actions or words. Like it or not, perception is everything.

### Run it back and reflect

 Instead of immediately continuing with your current activities, essentially ignoring a blatant misstep, pause and reflect on the problem you created. 

Reflection shows that you prioritize resolving the issue and are willing to put in the effort to make amends. Running what just happened back in your head could help you better understand how you made your error so that you can prevent a similar mistake in the future.

### Empathize and understand their perspective

 Does anyone remember a brief stint where most DevOps talks had an empathy component? Try to understand how the other person feels genuinely. See the situation from their point of view. Empathy plays a crucial role in a sincere apology.

### Offer a genuine apology

 Express your apologies sincerely and clearly (you don't need to use big words here). Make it clear that you acknowledge the harm you caused and empathize. State you did not intend to cause mental or physical harm.

### Commit to change

Promise to learn from the experience and commit to avoid repeating the same mistake. Show your willingness to grow and improve as a person.

### Take the initiative to learn

If this were a numbered list, this is always #1. It would be best if you balanced continuous learning by acknowledging that you understand your weaknesses.

Acknowledge that it's not solely the other person's responsibility to teach you where you went wrong. Demonstrate your commitment to personal growth by taking the initiative to independently learn and educate yourself about the issue.

### Give them space

Validating your apology is not mandatory. You must accept that you can apologize and may never be forgiven. Be humble. Be honest with yourself.

Understand that others may need time and space to process their feelings. Respect their boundaries and allow them to decide how they want to proceed.

## Biases 

Realize that you have subconscious biases. You should at least understand what a subconscious bias is. I have found many of mine come from family/upbringing, where I lived growing up (southeastern United States), and the US military and intelligence community. Identifying your biases will bring you a new perspective, improving your decision-making capabilities.

By being an ally, individuals can support and amplify the voices of underrepresented minorities and create an environment that is welcoming and supportive of all individuals. Allies should advocate for equal opportunities and fair treatment, challenge bias and discrimination, and create space for diverse perspectives to be heard. This leads to a more productive, creative, and thriving industry that reflects and meets the needs of the diverse communities it serves.

## What can you do?

There are many things that technologists can do to make the industry a better place for underrepresented folks:

### Educate yourself

Learn about the challenges faced by underrepresented minorities and understand the importance of others' strifes. Start with the folks closest to you. Learn about the things impacting them daily and for generations. Get out of your comfort zone and build out more understanding from there. 

### Mentorship and sponsorship

You can become mentors or sponsors for underrepresented minorities, help them navigate their careers, and help find opportunities for them to succeed.

### Challenge bias and discrimination

We should challenge prejudice and discrimination whenever we encounter it. Call it out on the spot if you have to. The disadvantaged should not be the only ones to defend themselves against systemic discrimination. 

Actively work to create a more inclusive environment. We must create environments where everyone feels safe speaking up without being retaliated against or even marginally maligned for voicing concerns/ideas.

## Advocate for change

We can advocate for changes in policies and practices that may exclude underrepresented minorities and promote diversity and inclusion in our organizations. Joining or sometimes forming senior leadership-backed underrepresented groups in the workplace can be a part of the broader organization's continuous learning.

At AWS, I'm part of Glamazon, Mental Health and Wellness, and People with Disabilities Affinity Groups. Are they perfect fits? Not 100% of the time; that's impossible. But, there is always something worth contributing to inside your organization to help make it a more welcoming environment.

### My little corner of this world

I'm a disabled veteran in constant pain. Impacted by nerve damage, a shoulder injury, and countless horrors, Adversity starts when my alarm clock goes off. But I'm not proud of my time in the service. I joined because of the dot-com bubble. Eleven years later, after a previously failed attempt during my stint in the intelligence community, I was medically separated.

I often point out that AWS' Glamazon Affinity Group (in Amazon parlance) puts some of our other groups to shame. Glamazon has done more to make me feel included as a disabled veteran at Amazon than all our other Affinity Groups combined.

The previous paragraph is solely my opinion. I am okay with this. Everything is working as intended. I'm not complaining or requesting a change. I'm sure as hell not volunteering feedback or asking to lead any changes. I'm good. I promise I'm at or over my max.

### Diversify recruiting efforts

Allies can work to diversify recruiting efforts and actively seek out talent from underrepresented groups. The relationships you form become your network. Use the folks you're helping to bring in people they recommend.

Some of the most brilliant people in the Golang community are underrepresented. Some of the best people to work with in the Kubernetes community are also underrepresented in tech. Amplifying their work and their outputs does far more than you'd think.

**Bonus**: Connect hiring managers with folks you've allied with.

### Foster an inclusive culture

Fostering a culture of inclusion is hard, but it is vital. Allies can foster an inclusive culture by sharing knowledge, encouraging open communication, respecting diverse opinions, and promoting a sense of belonging for all employees. Your circle should naturally be open. Always a space for another perspective. I need to remember the name for this, but we do it in the Kubernetes community, and I've connected with so many folks this way.

### Support community initiatives

Technologists can support community initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, such as conferences, mentorship programs, and diversity scholarships. 

These actions allow technologists to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for underrepresented minorities in the tech industry. We know this brings strategic advantages to every team out there. Be like a shoe and "Just Do It™.️"

## Conclusion

In conclusion, allyship and mentoring are vital for creating a more diverse and inclusive tech industry. White males need to practice this the most. We must recognize our privileges and role in making space for more diverse perspectives and people from all walks of life. The well-represented should use their positions to lift the underrepresented and unprivileged up. Truly leveling the playing field is the role of our generation.

We, the well-represented and privileged, must recognize actively seeking out opportunities to mentor and support underrepresented minorities. We can help level the playing field and ensure everyone has equal opportunities to succeed. By challenging bias and discrimination, diversifying recruiting efforts, and fostering an inclusive culture, we can create an industry that is more innovative, productive, and reflective of the diverse communities it serves—ultimately, working together as allies can create a better future for ourselves, our colleagues, and our industry.
