After running a [weekly DevOps and Cloud Native newsletter](https://devopsish.com) for three years, it became clear to me that a lot of folks don't appreciate the fact that there is a world outside of tech. To me, it's naive to want to stay uninformed about things outside of one's perspective. But, I get some pretty disgusting and gross messages whenever I discuss marginally unpopular opinions about popular technologies, companies, or products. The truth comes at a high cost. With that in mind, I would much rather have multiple on-topic newsletters as opposed to a single massive newsletter.

It is my distinct pleasure to introduce [**geopolitics.dev**](https://geopolitics.dev), a newsletter to help technologists, nerds, journalists, and politicians understand where their worlds intersect. I worked in the US Air Force, doing things that I would later learn were called DevOps. I worked in the communications and intelligence spaces. Things I was helping keep an eye on before getting out in 2010 are problems for the world now. The world we live in is incredibly interconnected, whether you want to admit it or not. In the wake of the Snowden leaks and Huawei trade issues, I have been told I have a view of the world that a lot of others don't. I invite you to join me as I highlight important news items every week. [Subscribe today](https://geopolitics.dev/subscribe/)!
