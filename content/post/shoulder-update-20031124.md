Another update on my shoulder. The saga will probably continue well into next year but I'll be doing physical therapy and I will be scheduling a follow-up appointment for the 14th but basically the next step after physical therapy is orthopedics.

It appears that this will be a long, drawn out process. You gotta love HMOs.
