I was invited to speak at [DevOpsDays Detroit 2016](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-detroit/program/what-the-military-taught-me/). I had a fantastic time speaking with the crowd in Detroit. This talk was my first foray into the talk world. I went long and could probably optimize the content of the slides (less words). However, I was very happy with the positive feedback and was blown away by how great the DevOpsDays volunteers and organizers.
