Intro
First Day of Tech School
Shadow IT
Users Are Solving the Problems You Are Too Slow To
Conclusion (Let them and learn from them)

Envision a young nerd sitting in a camouflage uniform at a school house on Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi in the year 2000. In walks an instructor, an average height and weight Air Force Staff Sergeant (E-5), silently and calmly. The first thing the instructor does on the first day of a full-time four-month technical training program is write in large letters on the whiteboard at the front of the class, "USERS ARE STUPID."

Having already spent four years in the information technology field I could understand this reasoning in 2000. The past sixteen years have shown me this is an edge case now and the enterprise might be the stupid ones now.

In the year 2000, technology was definitely not in people's pockets like it is in 2016. There were no wearable devices, there was not a preponderance of cell phone usage, and mobile Internet was still very much in its infancy. Computer and network users had no experience with the tools that were now being thrust in front of them.
