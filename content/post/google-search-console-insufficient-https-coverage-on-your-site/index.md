I did a lot of SEO side work in the early 00s. Now, it's folks' full time jobs. I'd say 99% of the content is focused on Google. Back then, you had to make other search engines happy. Now you have to make ONLY Google happy.

In the early 2000s, I did a lot of side work around Search Engine Optimization (SEO). I'd help clients with their search engine rankings. Back then folks cared about all the search engines. Nowadays, there's only one search engine people care enough to write about, Google.

As [Matthew Broberg so eloquently put on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbbroberg/status/1385987372223979521), "Google is both the monopoly and trend setter. It's a good target either way you look at it." If you own a website and you care about it enough that you want people to look at it, do some SEO basics and [add your site](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34592?hl=en) to the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).

I've been reading more SEO related content lately as I've been trying to grow readership of this site and my newsletter, [DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com/). I've been watching traffic in Google Search Console to this site dipping over the course of the past few months and I started to seriously look into the matter over the weekend. Google shares quality information about your site with what it calls, "[Page experience signals](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/page-experience#signals)" which encompass [Core Web Vitals](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/page-experience#core-web-vitals), [mobile friendliness](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/page-experience#mobile-friendly), and [HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/page-experience#https).

If you're not serving your site over HTTPS, you're going to get a huge penalty on Google Search Results Pages (SERPs). Everyone wants to be on the front page of Google, there are [many jokes about how the second page of Google search results are akin to being thrown into an abyss](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/google-page-two). I could make a joke about how SEO content is nothing but a series of links to pages with a series of additional links to other pages all of which you must consume and apply to get to the first page of Google.
