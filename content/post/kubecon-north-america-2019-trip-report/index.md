Disclaimer: I work for Red Hat, [my views and opinions are solely mine](/terms/) though.

I attended, worked, volunteered, spoke, etc. in San Diego at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019. Overall, 12,000 people attended the conference which was held in the same venue ComicCon is held every year. The event was absolutely grueling and it has taken almost a full week to recover. To give you an idea, I didn't even want to write the bare minimum report I sent internally to Red Hat. I was in so much pain that reliving the week felt like it'd probably do more harm than good so I put off writing this trip report for a week.

Why? I'll get into that. But, to give you an idea of how I felt a day after KubeCon ended, I wrote in [DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com/155/) that I wasn't sure why I put in so much energy:

> I can tell you for certain, I’m not the only one that feels this way. One CNCF Ambassador already hung it up. I have legitimate concerns about the long term viability of Cloud Native Computing Foundation. At this rate of disregard for the communities forming underneath it, the intent seems to get as much money as possible at all costs. It’s frustrating as hell and I’m still mulling what to do.

For my own health and for the benefit of others, I'm going to recap my KubeCon NA 2019 experience. It will be hard to read at points, feel free to skip ahead. But, this is me going through an event 12,000 other people did. Just because my experience was a net negative for me, it doesn't mean that was the case for everyone. To be clear, this is my account of my time. I'm still a CNCF Ambassador because I'm going to work to fix the problems.

## The Run Up

Once I got done with [AnsibleFest](https://chrisshort.net/ansiblefest-atlanta-2019-trip-report/), I immediately shifted my event focus over to KubeCon. I reached out to my colleague Josh Berkus in the Red Hat Open Source Program Office to see where I could help with the KubeCon NA 2019 Contributor Summit. Josh said I should with the Contributor Workshop. I reached out to Guinevere, Rael, and Marky to see where they needed help and off we went.

At first, the team seemed a little small to me but, I think we had four people between two sets of cirriculum. New and Intermediate Contributor Workshops were going to be combined for the first half of the day then split when it was time to go hands-on. I got into the [combined workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18LcwvqyNn74HgqIk7O-ChgfSsJAqDIYm7obguEXto4Q/edit?usp=sharing) and immediately saw nits I couldn't let fly. I'm a real stickler for slides. I spent over half my Air Force career as a non-commissioned officer and the past two in "marketing" roles. One thing I can't stand is inconsistent font selections. I spent a few evenings pouring over all 230 slides trying to make improvements to every slide. The alignment of objects, font face, images, etc. were all tweaked in some capacity. To me, these are table stakes things that I do to every slide deck I work on. I've done this for two decades now, I can list my nits here:

* Images that don't have transparent backgrounds: for example, a white rectangle surrounding a cartoon Where's Waldo
* Inconsistent font faces: Arial here, Calibri there. Google Sans not Open Sans. It bugs me when I see it so I fix it.
* Alignment: The entire deck should allow the viewers eye to flow like water over and through the content. Misaligned text blocks or images that force the viewer to move their eyes like a pinball slapped about is not conducive to learning.
* Sentences instead of bullets: If I can say it in five words, it shouldn't take two lines. Don't write sentences in slides unless it's a quote, theorum, law, etc. Tight bullet points only.
* Mismatched layouts: Copy and pasting slides is cool. I wholeheartedly approve of repackaging good content. But, it should match the medium it is being pasted into. To be honest, it's often easier to create a new slide with the new deck's layout and 'Paste without formatting' from the source material. This way the content matches the new deck's layout.

Two-hundred and thirty slides. I touched almost every one. That in itself was a lot of work. But, I needed to actually add content and bring things up to date too. Also, I needed time to familiarize myself with the content to be able to actually teach it. Keep in mind, we didn't have this workshop or a well documented process when I jumped into the Kubernetes community. Also, I don't think I was actually a member of the Kubernetes GitHub organization until this year despite having a contributor patch since 2017. This was likely several people's first experience in the Kubernetes community and maybe even some people's first time using GitHub. I put a lot of pressure on myself to get this right.

As the date approached, I could feel the unnecessary pressure I put on myself to make this perfect start turning into a cold of some sort. This is how my body tells me to slow down. The last time I didn't listen to this signal, I wound up with a long, debilitating case of Shingles that sidelined me from KubeCon EU and China last year. This is something I'm actually working on in therapy. From 9/11 to the end of 2010, I lived in a "You have to be lucky all the time. We only have to be lucky once." world in the military. When I start to get stressed and overwhelmed, I instinctively invoke some of the not so healthy endurance skills I learned. This leads to the need to be perfect all the time mentatility too apparently. I'll keep that in mind in the future.
