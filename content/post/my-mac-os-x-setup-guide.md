I happen to be someone that finds themselves setting up new systems for myself often. I have to remind myself there are tools that I need installed before the scenario in which I need to use them (on an airplane, during a crisis, etc.). I use a Mac so this list of software and setup is going to be very Mac OS X centric.

The majority of my time is spent in iTerm and Google Chrome. Google Chrome backs up my extensions, settings, etc. but iTerm does not have a reliable backup or sync solution. As a result I save the iTerm com.googlecode.iterm2.plist file to Google Drive. That way it is constantly synced to a cloud source.

I spend a lot of time in vim as well. As a result, I update my .vimrc file accordingly. I have an Ansible Playbook to update vim settings as I like a specific color scheme. I try to stray from defaults as little as possible but it happens.
