Costovertebral Dysfunction of Rib T-8. That's what's wrong with my shoulder. After a year and a half of worthless medical treatment the military doctors have finally figured out what's wrong. There is a rib bulging out from my spine just below my shoulder blade. This is what is pushing back against the muscles in my shoulder thus making my shoulder hurt.

Last Tuesday, a physical therapist folded me up like a lawn chair trying to discover the cause of my pain. Since the rib has been set back in place I've been in a constant state of pain and discomfort. About every three days it's going to be reset; that means that the pain will continue until it's truly fixed.
