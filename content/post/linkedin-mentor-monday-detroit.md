I had the opportunity to be a mentor at [LinkedIn Mentor Monday Detroit](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/activity:6362098620212273152/). It was a chance to talk to younger folks to get a gauge on what they are thinking and where they see their careers heading. Plus, I welcome any opportunity to help the good folks of Detroit make Detroit the great city we all know it is. Huge thanks to [Jessica Addison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicaaddison/) of LinkedIn for inviting me. Also, a shout out to [LeGenevieve "Vieve" Squires](https://www.linkedin.com/in/legenevieve-squires-b19448122/) of Starbucks for hosting us in Downtown Detroit.

I sat down with three up-and-comers here in Metro Detroit:

* Kish is finishing his GED and trying to break into the construction scene as an electrician.

* [Salomé](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salomé-mesdesirs-4119b6aa/) is a French national aspiring to be an investigative journalist. I answered many questions about journalism in America and gave her some social media tips.

* Andy, who is a student in Environmental Systems and Music Technology, peppered me with some well-thought-out questions about work ethic and technology.

The LinkedIn Mentor Monday program is in its infancy. If you ever have the opportunity to take part in a Mentor Monday event, I highly recommend it. And if you are in Detroit and want to tag along with me to the next event, let me know.
