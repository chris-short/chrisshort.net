The month of October was quite unique for me. I went to a number of conferences and talked to tons of people from all walks of life. All of the events were great; DevOpsDays Raleigh, AnsibleFest Brooklyn, DevOpsDays Detroit, and All Things Open are all events I would recommend to anyone considering them.


One distinctly unique opportunity was to sit down with the folks from The Cloudcast to tell my [**DevOps**](https://devopsish.com/) story. [The Cloudcast #277 - DevOps Perspectives from the Front Lines](http://www.thecloudcast.net/2016/10/the-cloudcast-277-devops-perspective.html) is available on their site or you can listen here:
