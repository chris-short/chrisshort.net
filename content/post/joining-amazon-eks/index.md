"Life is just a gap—get some money in between it." —Lil Wayne

I've always liked the color orange. Baptised as a child in chants of Orange and Blue between the student side and the alumni side of [Ben Hill Griffin Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hill_Griffin_Stadium). It only makes sense that orange is one of the predominant color of the logos my new team uses. I'm happy to announce I'm joining the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service team as a Developer Advocate.

## Developer Advocate

Developer Advocacy is right in line with [a statement I've had on my resume](/resume/) since I've had a resume: "Technology exists to improve human existence." I've thought this since before I started in tech. I used this mantra when helping folks at my first IT job in the summer of 1995 when I was fifteen years old (it was called MIS back then). In a very forward leaning environment, all summer long, my team kept throwing problem after problem at me and I'd solve them the best of my ability. If it was a [PEBKAC](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pebkac.htm), I made sure that, for example, the solution to their problem was a double click away on their Windows 3.11 desktop (a Windows shortcut to a batch script could solve a lot of problems back then in enterprises).

But, let me tell you a story first...

## Storytime

One of the first customer visits I ever did at Red Hat as a TMM (before the pandemic) was to a customer that was about to make the jump over to AWS from OpenShift. At one point, I asked the customer what kinds of hurdles were in the way process wise to getting resources on each provider they used.

The internally hosted OpenShift had all the traditional, "your VM will be ready in six to nine months," problems I'd expect in a large enterprise that hadn't embraced DevOps, lean, or any [Westrum](https://itrevolution.com/westrums-organizational-model-in-tech-orgs/)-based, or [Forsgren](https://nicolefv.com/)-based methodologies (read [Accelerate](https://amzn.to/2LQSZ3D)).

Access to AWS was essentially unfettered. The AWS team worked with stakeholders to make it that way. AWS rolled up its sleeves, got in there, and worked with whomever it took to help the organization excel with its products. Most big tech companies do this but, AWS is literally the best I've seen at it.

### AWS excels at implementing their solutions with customers

That experience is on par with every experience I've had with AWS professionally. They do things right to get their customers using their products in often times groundbreaking ways. They'll help you get through some enormously rough patches too.

AWS combines great technology with talented people to make their solutions work for their customers. They will put boots on the ground, educate teams, inform executives, and get their ideas into production on AWS. It's almost a whatever it takes attitude. Having that kind of ally at your side is empowering. That's an amazing super power as a company and they do it the best everyday.

### Staring up at AWS every month lead me here

Live streaming was fun for a while. But, I was on an unsustainable path. I wanted to be on top of the mountain in clean, fresh air. Every month, I'd sit down to "run the numbers" and was always staring up at AWS' enormous audience figures. I studied what they were doing. Amazon took their live streaming way more seriously than I could ever convince Red Hat leadership to. Recently, I watched Jeff Barr announce a *bunch* of new product offerings on [AWS Twitch](https://twitch.tv/aws) with an American Sign Language interpreter. "Wow... Just wow." I thought.

## I'm so happy

Now, I'm off to be what I've wanted to be since the day I realized Developers need help getting their solutions into production. I can be a Developer Advocate for the number one cloud provider on the planet's Kubernetes service (EKS).

This is quite literally a dream come true. I've had Amazon in my sights for a while now. My first interview at Amazon was a total flop in 2012 (but, I did get to see Seattle so that was nice). Amazon has improved their pre-interview process to get candidates ready for their upcoming interviews.

Now, I'll get to push feedback into a widely used Kubernetes offering. I'll work with folks developing amazing things on the service. Best of all, my community work still aligns with my work-work. Like always, I hope to do even more at AWS. It's all about impact and where I feel I can make the greatest impact. The scale of AWS is dauntingly vast.

## Wait... Didn't you have a ridiculous AWS bill recently?

Yep, [sure did](/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/). I might have exposed a bug between S3 and CloudFlare too. This led to a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people. Including, a product team that was trying to help people like me (that run [several web sites](/projects/)). The experience during and after my AWS bill experience fascinated me. The fact that:

1. Amazon dug into the issue with me once the bill was resolved. They wanted to know EXACTLY what I knew about the incident. I potentially invoked a bug and there was no holding back the interested parties once I opened the door to figuring this out. This was my first time seeing the "customer obsession" side of Amazon to this extent. I was fascinated.
1. The fact another product team at Amazon reached out and tried to work with me on a viable solution to meet my needs specifically was also very cool. They weren't solving my use case so they upped the priority. 
1. I have a lot of friends in the Amazon orbit and that showed that stressful weekend not too long ago.
