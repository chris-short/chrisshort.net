## 8:56 AM ET

I woke up this morning at 0230 experiencing the worst pain I've ever felt in my shoulder. I took my medication which didn't really help and sat in front of the computer until it was time to go to work.

At this moment I'm in the hospital waiting to be seen. Something has to get done and it has to get done today.

I do have an appointment for the 25th with orthopedics but I can't take this kind of pain for another month.

I think I've been more than fair with the military in the past eight months since I injured this shoulder now it's time to pay the piper.

We'll see what happens.

## 5:25 PM ET

Well the three hours in the hospital today didn't really do much for me.

They took a ton of x-rays and suggested that I take more of the medication I'm currently on.

The only good thing was that my orthopedics appointment was moved up from the 25th to the 4th.

We'll see what happens then.
