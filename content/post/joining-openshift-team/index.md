This Monday (2019-08-19) will be my first day as Principal Technical Marketing Manager on the Cloud Platforms team at Red Hat. What does that mean? [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) (a lot of OpenShift), Kubernetes, containers, Operators, and all the associated bits will be my day job. Helping folks help themselves with technology is still and always will be the name of my game. But, working full time in the Kubernetes or cloud native ecosystem was a 2020 goal. Crossing off 2020 goals in 2019. #winning

## Wait... There's still work to do

My involvement with Ansible won't end. Oh, heavens, no! I am still involved in AnsibleFest (see you in Atlanta).  Part of my charge when joining Red Hat was to encourage more collaboration between the Ansible and OpenShift teams. That has been happening and will continue to happen with me sitting on the OpenShift side. I'm also acting as an Ansible insider for folks on the Cloud Platforms team. I've been told to be ready for a challenge and I'm looking forward to it.

When I announced I was joining the Ansible team, I wrote, "[I'd like to work to see what Ansible can bring to CNCF projects.](https://chrisshort.net/joining-ansible-team-at-red-hat/?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=141)" You can write Kubernetes Operators with Ansible. Also, Ansible Operators are now a priority. Let's face it; *more people know how to write Ansible than Go*. [Ansible Operators](https://ansible.com/operators/?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=141&utm_term=kubernetes) are something I hope I can hang my hat on some day. But, there is much work to be done still. Ansible's future lies in its ability to be picked up and used capably by almost everyone in the IT department. The more that thinking can be brought to the cloud native ecosystem, the better.

## Burnout

Last month, [I wrote about burnout in DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com/137/), "Values mismatch is something I am struggling with right now in my own position. I highly value working in the Kubernetes community. One of my personal goals is to work full time on Kubernetes (or closer to the core of it). However, my job on the Ansible team doesn’t directly benefit from this work. It does feel like I’m being stretched incredibly thin by the [#7 and #8 open source projects in the world](https://octoverse.github.com/projects.html). But, I also think that there are indirect benefits of this work. The problem is that it could lead to a perceived lack of fairness. I’m galavanting across the cloud native countryside some days while my co-workers are pushing the Ansible go to market strategy. Open source is weird."

The past year on the Ansible team kinda broke me down in other ways though. Don't get me wrong, [the first few months working on the Ansible team were phenomenal](https://chrisshort.net/the-importance-of-psychological-safety/). I won an award voted on by my peers and leadership. I was doing work and getting great feedback. But, the unknowns with IBM, leadership changes within my business unit, getting diagnosed with shingles, already having a disability, and receiving a serious mental health diagnosis, all broke me in ways I didn't know I could be.

I was still able to do work but, I had lost a lot of the passion. It was really apparent to me that I needed a change when AnsibleFest planning started in earnest. Within a couple of days into building tracks I was no longer willing to put forth the effort to debate what should go where. There were voices in the room that were strong and I really didn't want to inject my two cents. It was going to be an enormous amount of emotional effort I just didn't want to expend. I was conserving energy to work on what I think are equally if not more important things for AnsibleFest like diversity and inclusion. I am hopeful this will be the most inclusive Red Hat event put on to date thanks to the efforts of quite a few people across Red Hat and on the Ansible marketing team.

## Why now though?

I've been looking to make a move to the OpenShift team since before April (when things were calmer). I had a failed attempt at joining the Developer Advocates on the OpenShift team. That would have been fun but, the team rightly pointed at my utter lack of coding experience and decided otherwise. It stung a little but, makes complete and total sense. I am looking forward to working with the person they did end up hiring at some point.



Another motivator for making this move now, was when I took the time to move my newsletter, [DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com) out from behind Cloudflare. After several complaints from readers in Russia, I decided to put forth a modicum of effort to deter unfriendly regimes from blocking my various web properties.

I started to work on what I thought would be a relatively simple project: Building a globally load balanced block storage backed platform to host static web sites. After multiple attempts, consults with friends in and outside cloud providers, and quite a bit of discussion in the DevOps'ish Telegram I came to the conclusion that what I was trying to build wasn't possible unless I went all in with one cloud provider.

On another note, I think my desire to remain technically adept impeded my ability to adapt to this role. I still want to get hands on things. But, needed to think about messaging, strategy, events, web sites, blogs, and some big picture things. The context switch between hardcore product marketing to doing literally anything technical has become an increasingly harder and harder leap for me. Let alone the context switching necessary  It was almost as if I brought some code to the party people would look at me like I had three heads. Live and learn. I still accomplished a lot in the little over a year on the team as a product marketer.

## Thank you, Ansible

Thank you to the Ansible team and especially my Ansible marketing teammates. You've brought me into Red Hat, welcomed me with open arms, and shared your knowledge (and dogs) with me. You have all been wonderful teammates, and we'll continue to work together as Red Hatters in the future.
