The cortizone shot worked for a good two weeks but it has all but worn off now.

The pain persists and it is truly painful. The medication they have given me works but I can only take it once a day so there is a good 10 to 12 hours a day it hurts depending on what's going on.

I've got a follow up appointment in Orthopedics but I'm going to have to either get it moved up or postponed due to mission requirements.

More to come later.
