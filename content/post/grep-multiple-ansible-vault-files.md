Here's a handy one-liner to grep multiple Ansible Vault files (like group_vars). All you need is an Ansible Vault password file (outside of your configuration repo, please) and a little bash.

{{< highlight bash >}}
ls -1 | while read N ; do echo -n $N: ; ansible-vault --vault-password-file ~/.ansible_vault view $N | grep <STRING> ; done
{{< / highlight >}}
