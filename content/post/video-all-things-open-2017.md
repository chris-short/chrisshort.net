As previously mentioned, [I spoke at All Things Open](/all-things-open-2017-devops-readme.md/). Today, the good folks at opensource.com released video from the event. I really appreciate Nirmal Mehta taking the time to brainstorm the idea for this talk after DevOpsDays Raleigh 2017. I also am very thankful to Jason Hibbets and the opensource.com team as well as Todd Lewis and the All Things Open team for giving me the opportunity to [speak at such an awesome event](https://allthingsopen.org/lightning-talks-hosted-by-opensource-com/).
