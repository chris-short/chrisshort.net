I had my orthopedics appointment for my shoulder today. It went okay I guess. I told the doc I was tired of the pain and the runaround he understood then said that there might be a problem with my neck (more runaround).

However, he did schedule me for an MRI. So when I get a date for that I will let everyone know.
