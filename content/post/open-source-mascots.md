The open source software world is full of cute (and some not so cute) mascots of all shapes and sizes. I am not quite sure why software and animals go hand in hand so often nor am I sure what the origins of software mascots are. The intention of this post is to categorically enumerate open source softwares' characters. The reason I am doing this is to search for and acquire stuffed versions of these mascots for my infant son.

**Go gopher**

The subtly cute Go gopher ([that is its official name](https://blog.golang.org/gopher)) is the mascot for the powerful and Google backed golang programming language. I have seen the plush version of the Go gopher several times but for some reason they are not available from Google at the moment.

**Python Logo**

The Python logo is actually [two snakes](https://www.python.org/community/logos/). But, two snakes is not necessarily awesome in my opinion; I am not a fan of snakes.

**Tux** (Linux Kernel)

The grand puba of the open source software mascots. It's origins are well documented. A few years ago I bought good friends of ours a Tux doll from Thinkgeek for their first child. However, Tux is no longer available from there. The Tux plush dolls available at the time of this writing are not worth the cost of shipping.
