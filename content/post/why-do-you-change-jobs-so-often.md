Anyone who looks at my [resume](https://chrisshort.net/resume-cv/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherbshort) inevitably ends up asking me, "Why do you change jobs so often?" The question is an awkward one to answer. Lately I have been able to think about it more in-depth. I would like to share some of my thoughts on the frequency of my job changes.

**Process:** I love processes! Repetitive tasks and infrequently completed tasks benefit greatly from well documented processes. This is something the military taught me very well. When it came to our nation's secrets **process matters *greatly*.** If your organization has IT processes that add no quantifiable or measureable value to your business or the people executing the process do not understand that value, why does the process exist? If your answer is along the lines of, "That's just how we do it," or "We've always done it this way," it is a near certainty the process needs to be re-evaluated. There is one thing processes can benefit greatly from; *automation*. Poor processes or fear of automation is a guarantee I will seek employment elsewhere.

**Business Model:** A common reason I have left a company is that either the business model did not line up well with the market or the future outcome of the business was quite uncertain. One company I worked for freely admitted it was dying but was also in the process of pivoting. This was unnerving to say the least. It was especially unnerving because the people executing the pivot were not skilled in the new model. Also, the company was deeply in debt (but handling that very well). Meanwhile, other companies were adopting this new model faster. My employer was floundering defining what the new model was. New companies were coming along and filling the void during the pivot and doing it *VERY* well. If your business's future mission or business model is not clear nor well represented by leaders in the company this is a big problem. I probably would have stayed if the company did not think their future involved buying software to get them out of their conundrum; there needed to be more than just new tools.

**Unrecognized Technical Debt:** Unless you started your business yesterday, you have technical debt. I love when prospective employers are open and honest about issues in their environment. It is a little refreshing to know that there are issues that need to be addressed on day one. The problem is when there is an insurmountable amount of technical debt that no one has recognized previously. Things like rogue admins creating dependencies on external sources that only they maintain
