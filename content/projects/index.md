Like anyone who has worked on the web long enough, I have a lot of side things I maintain here on this site or elsewhere. Some of them are big, some are small. Some are modestly popular, others are barely noticed. But, they are also scattered across the web too. This page serves as a one-stop shop for all my projects big and small, young and old.

## Internal Projects

Things hosted here on [chrisshort.net](/)

### [Drawings](/drawings/)

I like good illustrations and infographics. A picture can convey a lot of info in very little time. I have a small collection of drawings that I share here to help provide information. I need to draw more as it's a good way to use the right side of the brain which improves mental health and PTSD symptoms.

### [Speed Testing](/speed/)

OpenSpeedTest powers the speed test tool located here on chrisshort.net. Want to test your connection speeds? Look no further. "No Flash or Java." ‚ÄîOpenSpeedTest

### [Status Page](https://status.chrisshort.net/)

Like every good service provider, I maintain a status page for my projects: <https://status.chrisshort.net/>

This comes in handy when [trying to convince Comcast/Xfinity there's an issue in their network](/having-a-status-page-forced-comcast-to-fix-my-internet/).

### [Writing Elsewhere](/writing/)

I like to keep track of the things I've written across the web. This page lists all the things written on other web properties or for work.

## External Projects

These are things I maintain outside of this website for the benefit of everyone.

### Content Delivery Network

shortcdn.com is the domain that I use to share files that are large or otherwise shouldn't be stored in a git repo. The main premise behind chrisshort.net is that it's an archive of all the things I have done. This archive should be available for the long term (think grand kids and their kids).

### Suggested Reads

If you've ever seen my social media posts with the hashtag [**#SuggestedRead**](https://bsky.app/hashtag/SuggestedRead?author=chrisshort.net) you know they can be great nuggets of information. These posts are things that I've consumed and feel other could benefit from.

Since Suggested Reads are shared to various social media networks (which can and do change) it made sense to create:

1. A central repository of all Suggested Reads
2. An interactive (voting, commenting, etc.) way for folks to consume Suggested Reads

The central repository of all the tech content I share is the [DevOps'ish Firehose](https://devopsish.com/firehose/). The [DevOps'ish subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsish/) is also powered by Suggested Reads. They also powered the DevOps'ish newsletter back when I was regularly publishing it.

### DevOps'ish

Originally started as a newsletter in 2016, DevOps'ish has evolved over the years to include the DevOps'ish subreddit and the DevOps'ish Firehose. All of these things share one thing in common; they are all ways to consume the various links and pieces I share out during the course of the day known as [Suggested Reads](#suggested-reads).

#### DevOps'ish Firehose

[DevOps'ish Firehose](https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsish/) is where all the tech links I save for others to consume as part of the #SuggestedRead process. Available as a web page or RSS feed.

#### [DevOps'ish subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsish/)

The [DevOps'ish subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsish/) is an interactive version of the DevOps'ish Firehose. The subreddit allows followers to interact with each other with the #SuggestedRead content

#### DevOps'ish Newsletter (on hiatus)

This newsletter is no longer being published.

*Cloud Native, DevOps, GitOps, Open Source, industry news, culture, and the ‚Äòish between.*

> Cloud Native, DevOps, GitOps, Open Source, industry news, culture, and the ‚Äòish between. A weekly newsletter assembled by open source leader, DevOps veteran, and Kubernetes Contributor Chris Short. Attempting to lower the barrier to entry into the DevOps and Cloud Native worlds while keeping seasoned professionals informed on the latest news, tools, and trends. Sign up for the newsletter today!
>
> I strive, every week, to put together the best newsletter covering DevOps, Cloud Native, and Open Source Software. The three main sections of the newsletter are People, Process, and Tools. They are in that order for a reason: People implement Processes using Tools. These three components should be cared for in that order too.
>
> Don‚Äôt take my word for it. See what [people way smarter than me are saying about DevOps‚Äôish](https://devopsish.com/praise/).
>
> [What is DevOps?](https://devopsish.com/what-is-devops/) I'm glad you asked!

## DevOps Newsletters

DevOps Newsletters is an idea that sprung out of an opensource.com article: [16 blogs and newsletters to follow for DevOps practitioners](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/devops-blogs-newsletters-follow)

> Keeping up with trends in the fast-paced world of DevOps is challenging. I might be dating myself, but I remember a time before there was a difference between front-end and back-end coders. Now, there is so much technology it makes little sense to try to keep up with everything.
> 
> DevOps and systems folks have less of a need to keep up with the day-to-day doings of front-end work. The inverse applies to front-end folks. Both disciplines are equally difficult to master, and to excel in either one requires an enormous amount of self-discipline. Regardless of what discipline you follow, it helps to stay current. Being well-read means reading long-form pieces as well as short-form ones such as blogs, newsletters, and occasionally social media posts.

[DevOps Newsletters](/devops-news/) intends to be a one stop shop for the best DevOps content from around the world.

> Continuous learning is a critical part of DevOps. Staying current is imperative. These are DevOps newsletters of note from several well regarded DevOps leaders.

### Kubernetes News

Inspired by [DevOps Newsletters](https://devopsnewsletters.com/) and Peter Benjamin's [How do you keep up with Kubernetes?](https://dev.to/petermbenjamin/how-do-you-keep-up-with-kubernetes-2209), [**Kubernetes News**](/kubernetes-news/) intends to be a resource to help keep up with the wide ranging and rapidly evolving world of Kubernetes.

### What is DevOps

[What is DevOps](https://devopsish.com/what-is-devops/)

> DevOps was intentionally left undefined (or loosely defined) at the first DevOpsDays event held in Ghent, Belgium. There are many good reasons for leaving it undefined. Back in 2009 in Ghent, no one could be sure how DevOps would impact the industry. But, the lack of a definition has left it available to be defined by anyone (myself included). This means a product can be DevOps and a business process can be DevOps. Neither of these is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù but, one adheres to the spirit of DevOps more than the other. Allow me to attempt to define and scope DevOps.

### ssl-tester (Public achieve)

A small Go app designed specifically to help troubleshoot certificate chains. A detailed use case that prompted the creation of this code was [featured on opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/17/4/testing-certificate-chains-34-line-go-program). I highly recommend reading it.

### rak8s (Public archive)

*Stand up a Raspberry Pi based Kubernetes cluster with Ansible*

ARM is going to be the datacenter and home computing platform of the future. It makes a lot of sense to start getting used to working in its unique environment.

Also, it's cheaper than a year of GKE. Plus, why not run Kubernetes in your home?
