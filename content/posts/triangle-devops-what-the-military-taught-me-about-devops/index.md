title: 'Triangle DevOps: What The Military Taught Me About DevOps'
---


I had the opportunity to present [What The Military Taught Me About DevOps](/what-the-military-taught-me-about-devops/) at the [Triangle DevOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-DevOps/events/235751024/) last night. It was a fantastic group of people and I fielded a lot of great feedback after speaking.

One takeaway I have from the talk, is that I need to get better at speaking on diversity issues. But, that is for another time.

One person asked if I would be willing to share my slides. I informed him that they were already shared but I think the [notes that accompany the slides](https://shortcdn.com/chrisshort/pdf/What%20the%20Military%20Taught%20Me%20About%20DevOps.pdf) are important to share too:
