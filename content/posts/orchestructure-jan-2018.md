title: Orchestructure January 2018 Meetup
---

I spoke at the first [Orchestructure](https://www.meetup.com/orchestructure/events/246812066/) Meetup of 2018. I have to admit, this is probably the smoothest run Meetup I've been a part of for quite some time. That's not to say other Meetups weren't well organized. But, Mario, Bob, and Jorge have their poop in a group. Orchestructure is one great Meetup. If you're in Michigan, you're missing out if you haven't attended.


I created a new Go talk for this group. I hope to reuse it to enlighten people on the awesomeness of Go. This talk is title *Go: Enabling DevOps To Go Faster*. The talk walks through why and who created Go, examples of the things that makes Go great, three uses of Go and the why behind them, and finally walks through how Go has bailed me out in the past.

If the second half of this talk looks familiar it's because it's from my [*Golang to the rescue: Saving DevOps from TLS turmoil*](/video/gophercon-2017-lightning-talk/) talk. I feel like telling the whole story of Go provides significantly better context to the DevOps use cases for Go. PDFs of the talk are available; one [with speaker notes](https://shortcdn.com/chrisshort/Go-Enabling-DevOps-to-Go-Faster-Notes.pdf) and the other [without notes](https://shortcdn.com/chrisshort/Go-Enabling-DevOps-to-Go-Faster.pdf).

Additionally, there is [video from the meetup available](https://youtu.be/fC_fmN5tXkQ). You can enjoy the dulcide tones of me fumbling through my slides randomly auto-advancing and Keynote completely freezing. This was likely due to me copying some slides that I used for an ignite talk. Those slides were configured to auto-advance every 15 seconds. Keynote is finicky and I hope Apple is putting some effort into make it better.
