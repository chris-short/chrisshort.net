---

I had the opportunity to participate in [All Things Open](https://allthingsopen.org/) this week. It was quite an experience. 3300+ people who are all part of the open source software community all in one place is truly moving. Even better they let me take a mic on one of the main stages to give a modified version of my [DevOps README.md](/devops-readme.md/) talk. I can't thank the opensource.com crew enough for the opportunity.
