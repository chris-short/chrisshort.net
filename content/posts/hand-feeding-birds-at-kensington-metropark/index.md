(Obvious answer: No)

Take a break from your normal DevOps and cloud native content for something, rather beautiful...

Yesterday, Julie, Max, and I took a fun little family trip over to [Kensington Metropark](https://www.metroparks.com/parks/kensington-metropark/) (Kensington). This is part of Michigan's Huron-Clinton Metropark system. Kensington itself is, "4,481 sprawling acres of wooded, hilly terrain surrounds[ing] beautiful Kent Lake". It is a big park on the outskirts of the Detroit Metro area. The amount of outdoor activities you can do at this park is astounding and it's a quick trip over to it.

Last week, Julie and Max discovered a trail where chipmunks and birds were eating nuts and seeds from peopleâ€™s hands in Kensington. This was hard to believe initially, but there were videos and photos of a chipmunk running up to Max and climbing up on his shoe. Julie also found a pond full of hungry catfish near this trail. On a beautiful Saturday afternoon in Michigan, we loaded up with two slices of bread for the fish and ten acorns for the birds and chipmunks.
