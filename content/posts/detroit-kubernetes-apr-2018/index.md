title: 'Detroit Kubernetes: Kubernetes Cron Jobs'
---

I spoke at [Detroit Kubernetes, Docker & all related things](https://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Kubernetes-Docker-all-things-Cloud-Native/events/249593802/) about Kubernetes Cron Jobs. The talk was more like an explanation with a demo. My demo skills are non-existent so I needed to build those a little. Overall, the demo went well. But, I feel like the zoom feature in Visual Studio Code needs some work. I ended up in iTerm2 using vim to make up for the oddities VSCode threw at me. All the code for the demo is available here: [chrisshort/k8s-cron-job-demo](https://gitlab.com/chrisshort/k8s-cron-job-demo)

The talk and corresponding demo is based on the article I wrote back in February, [*Kubernetes: Cron Jobs*](/kubernetes-cron-jobs/). I had Pushover notifications setup too so every time the cron job ran in minikube my Apple Watch would ping. It added a nice, albeit unintended, effect that I'll try to make use of during future demos for sure.
