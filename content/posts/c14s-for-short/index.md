title: c14s for Short
---

I had a random thought pop into my head during a conversation one night so I tweeted it, "Christophernetes"

Then Brandon Dimcheff chimed in with a very appropriate shortening, "c14s"

Then Andy Randall chime in with what is now my display name on Twitter, "c14s for Short"

Thank you **all** for this.
