title: Chris Short named Cloud Native Ambassador
---

While I was in Austin for [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2017](http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-and-cloudnativecon-north-america) I was told about the Cloud Native Computing Foundation Ambassador program. After reading up on it and experiencing the first day of the conference I decided to apply to become a Cloud Native Ambassador. The responsibilities are right in line with what I'm trying to do in Detroit. I would love to continue my community building around cloud native and open source projects.


It is with great pleasure that I can anounce that I have been named a **[Cloud Native Computing Foundation Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/)**. To quote the Ambassadors program web page, "Cloud Native Ambassadors (CNAs) are individuals who are passionate about Cloud Native Computing Foundation technology and projects, recognized for their expertise, and willing to help others learn about the framework and community."

My first act as a Cloud Native Ambassador will be to give a talk titled *Go: Enabling DevOps to Go Faster* at the [Orchestructure meetup](https://www.meetup.com/orchestructure/) in Ann Arbor, MI tonight at 6 PM ET. I have also reached out to some meetup organizers in Downtown Detroit. I would like to combine some of the disparate Meetups in the cloud native and DevOps spaces in downtown.
