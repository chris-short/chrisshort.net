title: Shoulder Update 2005-05-19

I had my "procedure" done on my shoulder this morning. Everything went fine. I was asleep and woke up and mobile so that is a good thing. However, I still feel like I'm having an out of body experience at the moment.

The good news is that the pain I had this morning is pretty much gone.
