[I presented my What the Military Taught Me About DevOps talk to a large crowd at DevOpsDays Toronto 2018](https://chrisshort.net/devopsdays-toronto-2018-what-the-military-taught-me-about-devops/). Off to the side of the stage was Ashton from [**Minds Eye Creative**](http://www.mindseyecreative.ca/). A beautiful piece of art was created from my talk and I cannot thank the DevOpsDays Toronto organizers enough for it.
