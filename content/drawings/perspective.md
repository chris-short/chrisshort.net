I like to remind everyone this time of year that, unless they have people's lives in their hands, you have to keep things in perspective.

Chances are you're in a terminal on a laptop on planet earth which is but one watery orb circling a star as it hurtles through the Milky Way which is but one of many galaxies moving across the universe. Try not to take things too seriously.
