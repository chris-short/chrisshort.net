Like anyone who has worked on the web long enough, I have a lot of side projects. Some of them are big, some are small. Some are modestly popular, others are barely noticed. But, they are also scattered across the web too. This page serves as a one-stop shop for all my projects big and small, young and old. **Pull requests are welcomed!!!**

## DevOps'ish

*DevOps, Cloud Native, Hybrid Cloud, Open Source, industry news, culture, and the 'ish between.*

DevOps, Cloud Native, Hybrid Cloud, Open Source, industry news, culture, and the 'ish between. A weekly newsletter assembled by open source contributor, DevOps veteran, and CNCF Ambassador [Chris Short](https://chrisshort.net/). Attempting to lower the barrier to entry into the DevOps and Cloud Native world while keeping seasoned professionals informed on the latest DevOps news, tools, and trends. Sign up for the newsletter today!

I strive, every week, to put together the best newsletter covering DevOps, Cloud Native, Hybrid Cloud, Open Source, industry news, and culture. The three main sections of the newsletter are People, Process, and Tools. They are in that order for a reason: People implement Processes using Tools. These three components should be cared for in that order too.

## DevOps Newsletters

DevOps Newsletters is an idea that sprung out of an opensource.com article: [16 blogs and newsletters to follow for DevOps practitioners](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/devops-blogs-newsletters-follow)

> Keeping up with trends in the fast-paced world of DevOps is challenging. I might be dating myself, but I remember a time before there was a difference between front-end and back-end coders. Now, there is so much technology it makes little sense to try to keep up with everything.
> 
> DevOps and systems folks have less of a need to keep up with the day-to-day doings of front-end work. The inverse applies to front-end folks. Both disciplines are equally difficult to master, and to excel in either one requires an enormous amount of self-discipline. Regardless of what discipline you follow, it helps to stay current. Being well-read means reading long-form pieces as well as short-form ones such as blogs, newsletters, and occasionally social media posts.

[DevOps Newsletters](https://devopsnewsletters.com/) intends to be a one stop shop for the best DevOps content from around the world.

> Continuous learning is a critical part of DevOps. Staying current is imperative. These are DevOps newsletters of note from several well regarded DevOps leaders.

## Kubernetes News

Inspired by [DevOps Newsletters](https://devopsnewsletters.com/) and Peter Benjamin's [How do you keep up with Kubernetes?](https://dev.to/petermbenjamin/how-do-you-keep-up-with-kubernetes-2209), [**Kubernetes News**](https://kubenews.net/) intends to be a resource to help keep up with the wide ranging and rapidly evolving world of Kubernetes.

## What is DevOps

[What is DevOps](https://devopsish.com/what-is-devops/)

> DevOps was intentionally left undefined (or loosely defined) at the first DevOpsDays event held in Ghent, Belgium. There are many good reasons for leaving it undefined. Back in 2009 in Ghent, no one could be sure how DevOps would impact the industry. But, the lack of a definition has left it available to be defined by anyone (myself included). This means a product can be DevOps and a business process can be DevOps. Neither of these is “wrong” but, one adheres to the spirit of DevOps more than the other. Allow me to attempt to define and scope DevOps.

## padbury.app

[Padbury Clock](https://padbury.app/) - An homage to Padbury Clock: A basic digital clock screensaver from Australian American designer Robert Padbury.

> Padbury Clock Screensaver, made by Robert Padbury, debuted on Product Hunt on 2015-03-26. It quickly rose to #3 Product of the Day. Rightfully so; Padbury Clock has been one of my favorite screensavers of all time since that day.

## ssl-tester

A small Go app designed specifically to help troubleshoot certificate chains. A detailed use case that prompted the creation of this code was [featured on opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/17/4/testing-certificate-chains-34-line-go-program). I highly recommend reading it.

*Stand up a Raspberry Pi based Kubernetes cluster with Ansible*

ARM is going to be the datacenter and home computing platform of the future. It makes a lot of sense to start getting used to working in its unique environment.

Also, it's cheaper than a year of GKE. Plus, why not run Kubernetes in your home?
