Kaslin Fields and I were talking about the social media landscape in 2025. I stated that social media might be coming to the end of its usefulness (at least centralized platforms).

The topic quickly turned to improving experiences on various platforms using Mute Words. I shared [my Mute Words](https://gist.github.com/chris-short/cfddde2120a2d4f1f6c2a852370dcdd6) as a GitHub Gist with them. But there’s some super shady stuff happening with centralized social media platforms. Let me break things down from my perspective (aka my opinion):

## Reddit

Reddit did its thing with API access to keep its business afloat and drive more ad revenue throughout the platform. Given the relatively high cost of hosting public infrastructure for millions of users, I understand their decision. Having a public API with many apps and users doing all sorts of things is also very expensive.

They are selling data to AI companies as fuel for their Large Language Models (LLMs). Their decision-making about the public API was likely based on monetizing content already being consumed for free (before the change) by OpenAI and others with billions of dollars in funding that Reddit does not have. I feel it’s safe to say you can blame generative AI for locking down Reddit’s public API. Nevertheless, I still find and post quality content on Reddit. If you use Reddit, please join the **[DevOps’ish subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsish)**!

## Facebook

Facebook is for connecting to family and folks back home. Meta owns it, and Mark Zuckerberg has decided that information operations on Facebook can and should flourish on Meta’s platforms with his axing of most moderation teams at Facebook. I’m not going to subject myself to that. At the same time, I can’t completely get rid of it, but I sure as hell can be active only when I choose to be.

## Instagram

Meta also owns Instagram. I have concerns about Meta’s use of Instagram photos to train AI, let alone the above-mentioned issues with Zuckerberg. Also, the forced following of accounts I wouldn’t typically follow is utterly insane. I want no part in Instagram anymore.

SCREENSHOT

Meanwhile, [**Flickr**](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chris-short/) is still going strong. Flickr will become my go-to place for picture/graphics sharing. Automation will propagate it to Mastodon and Bluesky,

## Threads (lol)

Meta also owns Threads. I posted there for a while, but I never got much engagement. At about the same time, Meta moderation policies changed, so I stopped posting there and deleted my account.

## Elon’s Dumpster Site (X, formerly known as Twitter)

Twitter/X is unmoderated and toxic. Elon Musk owns it, and no offense if you threw up Nazi salutes in public, I’m not going to use anything you make. Besides, most people I followed there have moved to other platforms. My muted words were often omitted from ads, platform content, and other gross practices. Many of us still have our Twitter accounts because that’s where our largest audience is (the Kubernetes community is included in this group).

## LinkedIn

LinkedIn is starting to become people’s text-based social media outlet of choice (at least for things deemed “professional” enough). There’s a penalty if your content links off the site and other algorithm shenanigans. But, it’s becoming people’s default choice because look at the alternatives. LinkedIn could do nothing and pick up more users naturally at this point.

## Mastodon

Mastodon is federated, which is fantastic. The server I’m on does an incredible job moderating and disconnecting from well-known toxic servers. The downside is that it’s no longer a concept the masses seem to understand. “What I log in to matters? Why? Aren’t they all connected?”

Folks are accustomed to one URL and one login to see everything on that network. When you make them choose one instance/server analysis paralysis kicks in. But Mastodon is an excellent option because of the federation and, most importantly, the lack of an algorithm. The tech community is split between Bluesky and Mastodon.

## Bluesky

Bluesky is powered by [AT protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol). This is great because people can engage on social media and maintain possession of their content. If you haven’t noticed, I’m a big fan of owning your web presence (this site showcases work I’ve done personally and professionally).  You can also verify yourself through a domain you own without hosting anything yourself (and you don’t need to impress a soul to do it). But, while it saw a flood of new users towards the end of 2024, in 2025, that seems to have slowed. I don’t think it’s novel enough for the masses. The tech community is split between Bluesky and Mastodon. I believe it’s leaning toward Bluesky becoming the default, but we’re a long way off from that.

TikTok has serious issues here in the US. The federal government employee ban is a "thing" with legitimate concerns. I am not a TikTok user. I have no intention of using it for anything personal or on my personal devices. If a future employer asks me to start posting to TikTok for work things, I hope they are ready for me to ask them for a separate device to do that.

### My Muted Words

Since my muted words were a topic of Kaslin and I’s discussion, I’ll share them:
