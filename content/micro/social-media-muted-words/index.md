I talked to Kaslin Fields about the [social media landscape in 2025](/social-media-landscape-in-2025/) last week. The topic quickly turned to improving experiences on various platforms using Muted Words. I shared my **Muted Words** with Kaslin to improve her experiences. It makes sense to share them so all can benefit from them.

Using social media can be hazardous to one's health. I mute many words to protect my peace while still engaging in the communities where I work and live. Occasionally, I need a break from specific trending news topics; that's where my Situational words come in.
