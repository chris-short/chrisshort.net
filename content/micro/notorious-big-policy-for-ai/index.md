title: Notorious B.I.G. Policy for AI Use

"Got lawyers watching lawyers so I won't go broke" â€”Notorious B.I.G.

This Notorious B.I.G. lyric in the 1997 song *Young G's* has lived rent-free in my head for decades now. It is a frequent reminder that redundancy is key and that you should stay on top of your business and personal interests. Don't hand your future off to just anyone. Be sure to have someone else check over what's happening if you're too busy to do it yourself. Biggie elaborates on this topic in this rare video interview (embedded below).

This method applies universally, though. It's not just about money or business dealings. It also can be applied to other parts of your life and day-to-day activities.

What does this mean? Suppose one AI tool spits out any given artifact. I then take that output and pose a question to another AI tool along the lines of what I'm trying to accomplish and validate the original AI's outputs against the second AI's knowledge. This method has helped me multiple times write better docs, code, and other text-based artifacts over the past few years.

Sometimes, it confirms that you're covering all the details needed for success (based on your prompt). In others, this "AI watching AI" policy has completely debunked the output of the original AI and suggested appropriate edits or complete rewrites based on additional information. When in doubt, you can always pull in a third AI to check up on both the AI's outputs.

I've mentioned the Notorious B.I.G. Policy for AI Use in passing on social media: "[**Got AI watching AI so I don't go broke.**](https://bsky.app/profile/chrisshort.net/post/3lfqoo5vv2j2n)" but, never fully explained the origins or what it means and feel like more than ever in the Generative AI world we're all living in.
