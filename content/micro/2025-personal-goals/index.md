I don't do New Year's resolutions but, I do goals. Losing weight is always a goal, for example. Doing things throughout the year to better myself is what I do. But, sometimes I need to make a list and here it is:

## Health

Maintain current health regimen and seek out solutions to long term problems. This is where science, technology, and human's meet. I'm a disable veteran who got out of the VA system because I'm certain they could not help me. With that being said, I need to seek out solutions to long term problems. Nerve damage I can't fix. It can be treated but it's symptom management at best.

In 2025, I am going to consider surgeries (because one is not going to do it). Be it disc replacements, spine fusion, or some unknown implant to help me minimize and manage pain (which will help all other health indicators). Drugs alone are no longer the answer. I have a tear in a disc in my lumbar spine (annular tear) and I'd like to see that be addressed somehow. I've spent the past two weeks dealing with it being aggravated once and it's debilitating. Time to try something else/new.

## Career

I want my mojo back. AWS has been a wild ride the past three years that [I'll be getting off of in 2025](/micro/looking-for-a-new-role-2025/). The medical exception process for disabled folks is arduous and after submitting a pile of paperwork with all the medical records and doctors' notes, and data within 45 minutes the first question was, "How many days a week can you be in the office?" That's corporate speak for, "We're not going to support you or your disability." A colleague of mine had to take a leave of absence to manage the process fully. That's utterly insane. I look forward to my next remote role.

## Technology

### Continue embracing our AI overlords

I use Claude and Perplexity from time to time and actually find myself enjoying the shorter interactions. I use Perplexity for research and it's pretty good. All of this is Generative AI though so I have to verify everything is up to snuff that it spits out. I've seen the error rates go down over the past four months and I've had Claude spit out some programs for me that would take months for me otherwise. I also have seen a few amazing use cases in the second half of 2024 that I hope pay off in 2025.

### Tech Sector

I think the most dire need in the industry right now is electricity. This is leading to some serious moves by both governments and corporations alike.  Nuclear reactors small and large now seem like the only reasonable option at the moment. Solar and wind aren't going away either but the NIMBYs have weighed in and aren't going to be putting windmills in their neighborhoods any time soon. I've often wondered if/when Home Owner Associations (HOAs) will help neighborhoods with cleaner energy and better internet access. Seems like the market is ripe for that. But, there's a lot of ways that can go wrong too.

Big Tech has to pay for the now astronomical price of GPU cores (when compared to CPU cores). With Nvidia cornering the AI market (70% market share is the number I keep hearing). I read a report the other day that said Nvidia is about to become TSMC's largest customer (currently it's Apple). 

### Kubernetes

I often wonder what we'd be doing nowadays if Kubernetes wasn't in the picture. Would Generative AI

### Home Lab

I updated this website over the holiday break. Now I need to optimize it (there's always room for improvement). I've done some testing and Hugo Page Bundles are where it's at and this website predates Hugo and Hugo Page Bundles by 10+ years. I'll be doing that work through 2025 in an effort to provide the best experience possible.

The next big home lab project is getting TrueNAS Scale on our QNAP NAS. Friends don't let friends buy QNAP. If you have a 20TB hard drive laying around, let me know, please.
