title: Common Display Resolutions
---

Have you ever needed to look up different display resolutions from their names? Yeah, me too. Here's a handy table to help you out:

| Resolution | Pixels |
|------------|--------|
| 540p / qHD | 960×540 |
| 720p / HD | 1280×720 |
| 1080p / Full HD / FHD | 1920×1080 |
| 2K | 2048×1080 |
| 1440p / QHD / QuadHD / WQHD | 2560×1440 |
| 2160p / UHD | 3840×2160 |
| 4K | 4096×2160 |
| 5K | 5120×2880 |
| 8K / 8K UHD | 7680×4320 |

**Note**: "4K" and "2160p/UHD" are slightly different—4K is actually a bit wider. Most consumer TVs are technically UHD, but everyone just calls it 4K anyway.
