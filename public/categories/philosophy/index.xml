      <description>A former co-worker and now friend used to have a tagline, &amp;ldquo;Everyday is a school day.&amp;rdquo; I remind myself of this fact nearly every time I learn something new. 2016 brought a lot of new knowledge and skill sets into my ever-expanding arsenal of tools.

      <description>I like to remind everyone this time of year that, unless they have people&amp;rsquo;s lives in their hands, you have to keep things in perspective.

Chances are you&amp;rsquo;re in a terminal on a laptop on planet earth which is but one watery orb circling a star as it hurtles through the Milky Way which is but one of many galaxies moving across the universe. Try not to take things too seriously.</description>

      <description>Taking ownership or &amp;ldquo;planting your flag&amp;rdquo; in an idea, work, or concept is often one of the best things someone can do. To sit in a room full of people and say, &amp;ldquo;This is mine. I will take care of it.&amp;rdquo; Makes everyone in the room know you are the point person committed to making it happen. The same holds true when discussing documentation, processes, and ideas for long-range planning.</description>
