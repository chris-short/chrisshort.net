      <description>Firefox has taken out a two-page ad in the New York Times! According to Firefox this is the, &amp;ldquo;largest open source fundraising campaign in history&amp;rdquo; and, &amp;ldquo;these folks were willing to put their name out there and be the first to publicly support Firefox and our community at a scale never before attempted in open source history.&amp;rdquo;
