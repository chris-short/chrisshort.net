I was interviewed by Matthew Peek, Military Collection Archivist for the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (later referred to as MP).
   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  The interview was well worth the time it took to coordinate and conduct it.</description>
