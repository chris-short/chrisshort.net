      <description>There are so many cool things about DNS one drawing is not going to do it justice. Please let this drawing serve as an inspiration to learn more about DNS.
DNS is awesome because it allows you to have a full blown CDN for next to nothing. All you have to do is create a CNAME that points to Amazon S3 or Google Storage.
If you are interested in monitoring your DNS records I would highly recommend dnsspy.</description>
