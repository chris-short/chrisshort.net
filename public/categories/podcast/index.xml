      <description>The month of October was quite unique for me. I went to a number of conferences and talked to tons of people from all walks of life. All of the events were great; DevOpsDays Raleigh, AnsibleFest Brooklyn, DevOpsDays Detroit, and All Things Open are all events I would recommend to anyone considering them.
One distinctly unique opportunity was to sit down with the folks from The Cloudcast to tell my DevOps story.</description>
