      <description>The open organization community at Opensource.com (of which I&amp;rsquo;m a member) is pleased to announce the immediate release of its newest book, The Open Organization Guide to IT Culture Change.

It&amp;rsquo;s also a matter of cultureâ€”the values that underpin behaviors, influence problem-solving capability, and facilitate truly revolutionary potential. Those values are open values.</description>

      <description>For the past year or so Microsoft has repeatedly said no to Open Source and more recently after numerous attempts to say no has opened up some of its source code to various businesses and governments.
