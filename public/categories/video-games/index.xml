      <description>I have to say that I was not too enthusiastic about Wii Sports Resort when its release was announced. What intrigued me, obviously, was the addition of the Wii MotionPlus functionality. Wii Sports Resort is essentially Wii Sports 2 with a resort/spa theme.
   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  All sports activities take place on an island which is explorable by plane (which I do enjoy). The added gyroscopes and spatial awareness added by the Wii MotionPlus accessory is pretty awesome.</description>
