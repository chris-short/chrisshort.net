      <description>&amp;ldquo;Fear leads to anger&amp;hellip; Anger leads to hate&amp;hellip; Hate leads to suffering.&amp;rdquo; Jedi Master Yoda
 On Saturday, my wife Julie, son Max, and I attended church. This was a very special mass as it was the mass at which Max was being baptized. Julie&amp;rsquo;s family was present as were friends of ours. As a lot of my friends know, I&amp;rsquo;m not religious. My stance on religion is that I choose complete freedom over being beholden to humans interpreting what they believe to be the word of God.</description>
