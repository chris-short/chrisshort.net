      <description>I try to keep the content tech related around here but some times an event triggers a fond memory in your past and you feel the need to write about it. In January 2010, I was in the Air Force and had the opportunity to get up earlier in the morning than normal to get on a bus and drive over to Welcome, North Carolina. For those of you that are not familiar with NASCAR, Welcome, NC is the home of Richard Childress Racing.</description>
