      <description>If you have not heard the news, Google Fiber is no longer expanding its installation in the 10 markets they service and the head of Google Access (the Google Fiber overlord company), Craig Barratt, is stepping down.
Also in the news, was a little-publicized statement from AT&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, where he said, &amp;ldquo;I will be sorely disappointed if we are not going head-to-head&amp;rdquo; with cable companies by 2021.</description>

      <description>As part of a North Carolina State Archives initiative to obtain oral histories of veterans I volunteered to be interviewed for the North Carolina Veterans Oral History Collection. I was interviewed by Matthew Peek, Military Collection Archivist for the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (later referred to as MP).
   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  The interview was well worth the time it took to coordinate and conduct it.</description>
