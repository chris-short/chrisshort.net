      <description>A few weeks ago a co-worker and I were discussing some things we really enjoyed about our work environment. It reminded me of a few key questions I ask (or things that I look for) during an interview that typically indicate whether or not a job is going to be a good fit or not.

      <description>I was reading through Wired magazine and saw a Windows 10 ad. If you&amp;rsquo;ve turned on a TV the past month you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the ad I&amp;rsquo;m referring to, this is just the print edition of the TV ad.

Or obsess about security.
To her, every screen is meant to be touched.
 And so on&amp;hellip; (here&amp;rsquo;s the full ad if you really want to see it).</description>
