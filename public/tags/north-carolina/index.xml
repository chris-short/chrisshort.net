      <description>I have accepted the position as Manager, Infrastructure &amp;amp; Operations at Bankrate in Detroit. Julie, Max, Sunny, and I will begin moving to Michigan in mid-June! I will be leading DevOps efforts as the Bankrate team transitions software stacks and moves from on-premise data centers to the cloud. I am beyond excited about the position and the work I will be doing.
Making the decision to leave North Carolina did not come easily.</description>

      <description>As part of a North Carolina State Archives initiative to obtain oral histories of veterans I volunteered to be interviewed for the North Carolina Veterans Oral History Collection. I was interviewed by Matthew Peek, Military Collection Archivist for the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (later referred to as MP).
   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  The interview was well worth the time it took to coordinate and conduct it.</description>
